646	en	am	 Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers. 	ከተለያዩ አይነት እንስሳ ተሸካሚዎች በተለየ፣ በቫይረሱ በኩል ላይ ያሉት ሶስት ዋና መንስኤዎች በመላ የተዋህሲ ገደቦች ላይ ኮቮችን ለማመቻቸት በጣም አስፈላጊ ናቸው።	Unlike different types of animal carriers, the three main causes of the virus are essential to optimize covos across the entire compound limit.
647	en	am	 First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication. 	በመጀመሪያ ከፍተኛ ተነፃፃሪነት ለዉጣቸዉ የሚለካዉ በአርአኤንኤ ብዜት ውስጥ ነዉ።	First of all, the highest level of transparency is measured in terms of quality.
648	en	am	 In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts. 	ከሌላ ነጠላ-የተጣመሩ RNA ቫይረሶች ጋር በማነፃፀር፣ የተገመተው የኮቮች ልውጥ መጠኑ፣ ለኖቭል ተሸካሚዎች የኮቭ መላመድ ደረጃ መሰረት በአማካይ ምትክ መጠን ~10-4 ምትክ በየአመት በየቦታው 2 በመሆን ከ “መካከለኛ” እስከ “ከፍተኛ” ሊመደቡ ይችላሉ።	"Compared with other single-paired RNA viruses, the estimated covoch exchange rate, for the CoV carriers, can be classified from ""medium"" to ""high"" every year in place of an average replacement rate of ~10-4 in place of the CoV adaptation phase."
649	en	am	 CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability. 	ኮቮች የማረጋገጫ-ንባብ ኤክሶሪቦሊክሊስ አላቸው፣ የዚህ መጥፋት በጣም ከፍተኛ የሆነ የባህሪ ለውጥ እና መመናመን ወይም መቀጠል አለመቻልን ያስከትላል።	Covots have a confirmation-reading exolybolicle, the disappearance of which results in a very high degree of behavioral change and the inability to decline or persist.
650	en	am	 Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 	በጣም የሚገርመዉ፣ የሬምዴስቪር ኒኩሎቶይድ ተመሳሳይናት የኮቭ ብዜትን በመጨቆን ነዉ የሚታወቀዉ፤ ይህም ይህን ኤግዞሪቦኖኩለስና RNA ጥገኛ RNA ፖሊሜርስ በማቆየት በኩል ነዉ።	Surprisingly, the same remdesvir niculothoids are known for oppressing cove, which is the result of retaining this erybonoculose and RNA dependent RNA polymers.
651	en	am	 Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials. 	Remdesivir በክሊኒካዊ ሙከራዎች ውስጥ ከሚመረመሩ በጣም ተስፋ ሰጪ የሆኑ ፀረ ሳርስ-ኮቭ-2 ኤጀንቶች መካከል አንዱ ነው።	Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
652	en	am	 Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts. 	ነገር ግን፤ የኮቭች የማራባት አቅም በሚሊየን ግዜ ከተሸካሚዎቻቸው ይበልጣል።	But the capacity of the covesters is greater than their counterparts in millions of times.
653	en	am	 In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host. 	በተጨማሪም፥ ኮቮች ከተሸካሚው ጋር በሚገባ ሳይላመዱ ሲቀሩ አፈንጋጭ ዘረመላዊ ልውጠት (ሚውቴሽን) የማካሄዳቸው መጠን በአብዛኛውን ከፍተኛ ነው።	In addition, when covos are not well adapted to the bear, the rate of a collision is largely high.
654	en	am	 Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans. 	ከፍተኛ አፈንጋጭ ዘረመላዊ የልውጠት መጠን ካለው ሳርስ-ኮቭ ጋር ሲነፃፀር፥ የሳርስ-ኮቭ-2 አፈንጋጭ ዘረመላዊ የልውጠት መጠን በግልፅ ዝቅ ያለ ነው፤ ይህም ከሰዎች ጋር ያለውን ከፍ ያለ የመላመድ ደረጃ አመላካች ነው።	Compared to SARS-CoVs, which has a high level of racial exchange rates, SARS-CoV-2's genetic exchange rate is clearly low, which is an indicator of the higher level of adaptation with humans.
655	en	am	 Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans. 	ምናልባትም፥ ለሰዎች ቅርብ ከሆነ ሌላ ተሸካሚ ጋር ቀድሞውኑ ተላምዶ ሊሆን ይችላል።	It may be that you have already been used to another carrier that is close to people.
656	en	am	 In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels. 	ከ ሳርስ-ኮቭ-2 በተጨማሪ፣ ሜርስ-ኮቭንም ይመለከታል፣ ይህም በባለአንድ ሻኛ ግመሎች ላይ የተላመደ ነው።	In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also looks at Mers-Cove, which is adapted to a single-sized camel.

658	en	am	 Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate. 	ሁለተኛው፣ በኮቮች ውስጥ ያለው ሰፊ አርኤንኤ ጄኖም በባህርይ ለውጥ እና ዳግም ውህድ በጂኖም መሻሻል ውስጥ ተጨማሪ ፕላስቲክነትን ይለቃል፣ በዚህም ለበይነዝርያዎች የጋራ-ዝግመተ ለውጥ እድልን የሚጨምር ሲሆን ሁኔታዎች አመቺ በሚሆኑበት ወቅት የኖቭል ኮሮናቫይረስ እንዲከሰት ምቹነትን ይፈጥራል።	Second, the vast RNA genome in the Covos releases more plasticity in the development of the genome through the modification of the genome through a change and re-synthesization, thereby increasing the possibility of co-evolution for the cysts and creating the convenience of the novel coronavirus when conditions are favorable.
659	en	am	 This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome. 	ይህም በርከት ባሉ ልዩ ግልፅ የንባብ ማዕቀፎች እና ወደ ጂኖም 3′ ማብቂያ እንዲገቡ በተደረጉ የፕሮቲን ተግባራት የሚደገፍ ነው።	This is supported by a number of unique clear reading centers and protein functions that have been introduced to genome 3′ end.
660	en	am	 Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism. 	"በሶስተኛ ደረጃ፤ ኮቭች RNA ሲባዛ በድንገት እና በተደጋጋሚ በልዩ ""ቅጂ-ምርጫ"" ዘዴ ራሱን ማባዛትና መለዋወጥ ይችላል።"	"Thirdly, when covch RNA multiplies, it can reproduce and exchange itself suddenly and repeatedly with a special ""copy-selection"" method."
661	en	am	 In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription. 	እንደ ማቀላቀያ የሚያገለግል ተሸካሚ ዉስጥ፣ የዘለላ ለወጥ በተደጋጋሚ የሚከሰተዉ በኮቭ RNA ግልባጭ ወቅት ነዉ።	In a carrier that serves as a mixer, a cluster change occurs frequently during the cov RNA copy.
662	en	am	 Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs. 	በከፍተኛ ሁኔታ ተመሳሳይ ሙሉ ርዝመት እና ንዑስ ጄኖሚክ አርኤንኤዎች እንደገና አንድ ላይ በመሆን አዲስ ኮቭች መፍጠር ይችላሉ።	With a high level of the same full length and sub-genomic RNA, you can create a new cove together again.
663	en	am	 Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9. 	የተፈጥሮ እንደገና መሰብሰብ ፊሎጄኔትክ ማራጃ በ ኤችኮቭች-HKU1 ና ኤችኮቭች-OC43 እነድሁም የእንስሳት ኮቭች በሆኑት በሌሊት ወፍ SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 ዉስጥ ተገኝቶ የነበረ ነው።	The natural reconnautation of Phylogentek Maraj was found inside the Night Bird SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9, which were also animal coves.

666	en	am	 Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events. 	የሳርስ-ኮቭ እንደገና መቀላቀል እንደ ምሳሌ ናዉ የተወሰዳ፤ ይህም በዝርያ ዉስጥ የሚተላለፍ ክስተቶች ወቅት የአዉንታዊ ምርጫማስረጃ ያሳየም ነዉ።	Sars-Cove's re-joining, for example, is taken as Nawu, which demonstrates a positive selection during the period of events in the race.
667	en	am	 Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein. 	በንፅፅር ትንታኔ ላይ በመመስረት በሰዎች እና ጥርኝ ሳርስ-ኮቭች ፣ ሳርስ-ኮቭ መካከል የተደረገው ንጠላ፣ በተለያዩ ተሸካሚዎች ላይ ፈጣን መላመድን፣ በተለይም ደግሞ በኤስ ፕሮቲን አርቢዲ ልውውጦች ውስጥ ፈጣን መላመድን ያከናውናል።	Based on comparative analysis, the single between humans and the kine sars-cov, SARS-CoV, performs rapid adaptation on different carriers, especially in S protein RCD exchanges.

747	en	am	 First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche. 	የሌሊት ወፍ ሳርስ-ኮቭ-2 በዘር ወደ ፓንጎሊን የምታስተላልፍ ከሆነ የሌሊት ወፍ እና ፓንጎሊን የሚያመሳስላቸዉ ምን እነደሆነ ማጥናት ያስፈልጋል።	If you are transmitting sars-cov-2 by race to pangolin, you need to study what the bat and the pangolin have in common.
748	en	am	 Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined. 	ሁለተኛ፥ የሌሊት ወፎች ወደ ሰው በሚፈጠር የቫይረስ መተላለፍ ውስጥ ይበልጥ ቀጥተኛ ሚና የሚጫወቱ ከሆነ፥ ሰዎች ከሌሊት ወፎች ጋር እንዴት ሊነካኩ እንደሚችሉ መታወቅ አለበት።	Second, if bats play a more direct role in human-to-human viral transmission, it should be known how humans can touch the birds of the night.
749	en	am	 Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified. 	በሶስተኛ ደረጃ ሶስተኛ አጥቢ እንስሳ እዉነተኛ አስተላላፊ ከሆነ ሰዎችን፣ የሌሊት አእዋፋትና ፓንጎሊንስ ጨምሮ ከሌሎች ዝርያዎች ጋር እንዴት እንደሚገናኝ ግልፅ መደረግ አለበት።	Thirdly, if a third mammal is a real transmitter, it should be clarified how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
750	en	am	 Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted. 	በመጨረሻ ብዙ አጥቢ እንስሳት የቤት እንስሳትንም ጨምሮ ለ ሳርስ-ኮቭ-2 ተጋላጭ ሊሆኑ ስለሚችሉ የኢንፌክሽን ክትትልና ምርምር ሁለቱም መደረግ አለባቸው።	In the end, many mammals, including pets, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, so both infection monitoring and research should be done.
751	en	am	 Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future. 	የሌሊት ወፍ፣ ፓንጎሊን ወይም ሌሎች እንስሳት ቢሆኑ ሳርስ-ኮቭ-2 ወይም የሱ ተዛማጅ ቫይረሶችና የሚመሳሰሉ ወደ ፊት በተፈጥሮ ተሸካሚ እንደሚተዋቅ ነዉ የሚጠበቀዉ።	Whether they are bats, pangolins, or other animals, sars-cov-2 or its related viruses and similarities are expected to be made into a natural carrier in the past.

1590	en	am	 Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals. 	በአለም አቀፍ ደረጃ ያለው የ PPE አቅርቦት በቂ ካለመሆኑ ጋር በተያያዘ፣ WHO የ PPE ፍላጎትን መቀነስን በቴሌሜዲስን፣ አካላዊ ገደብ ማለትም በንጹህ መስኮቶች አማካይነት የግድ ቀጥታ እንክብካቤ ማድረግ ያለባቸው ሰዎች ብቻ ይገቡ ዘንድ፣ ለአንድ ውስን ሰራ ብቻ የግላዊ መከላከያ ቁሳ ቁሶችን እንዲጠቀሙ፣ አንድን መተንፈሻ መሳሪያ ሳያወጡት ለብዙ ሰዎች እንክብካቤ በማድረግ፣ የግላዊ መከላከያ ቁሳ ቁሶች አቅርቦት ሰንሰለትን መቆጣጠር እና ምልክት ለማያሳዩ ሰዎች በማስተባበር አማካይነት ይጠቁማል።	When it comes to the inadequate supply of PPE globally, THE WHO suggests that reducing PPE demand can be achieved through telemedics, physical limitations, that only those who have to be directly careened by the average of clean windows, that they use personal protective materials for only one limited worker, that they can care for more people without having to remove a single respirator, that they control the supply chain of personal protective materials and coordinate coordination of those who do not show symptoms.
