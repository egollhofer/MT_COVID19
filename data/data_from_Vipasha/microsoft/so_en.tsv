Marka la qaado ilaa inta calaamado la yeelanayo waxa caadiyan u dhaxaysa ilaa shan maalmood laakiin waxa ay u dhaxayn kartaa laba ilaa afar iyo toban maalmood.	It usually lasts between five days and two to fourteen days.
1872	en	so	The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.	In kasta oo badanaa ay keento xanuun yar, waxaa jrii kara xanuun sanbabka ah oo fayrus iyo in unugyo badan shaqada joojiyaan.	Although it often causes a small amount of pain, it can be caused by viral lung pain and many cells stop working.

More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus first transmits to people when they get close to each other, and even through the saliva drops of the fly when coughing, sneezing or talking.
1875	en	so	More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.	In kasta oo dhibcanahan ay keeno neefsiga, waxa ay caadiyan ku dhacaan dhulka ama meelaha la taataabto halka iyada oo la kala fog yahay la kala qaadi lahaa.	Although these drops cause respiration, they usually occur on the ground or in touch areas where they would be separated.
1876	en	so	While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.	Dad badan ayaa ku qaadi kara marka ay taabtaan meel uu dul saaran yahay oo ay kaidbna taabtaan indhahooda, sankooda, ama afkooda.	Many people can get it when they touch a place on it and touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
1877	en	so	People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.	Fayrusku waxa uu meel saarnaan karaa isaga oo nool ilaa 72 saacadood.	The virus can be in place alive for up to 72 hours.
1878	en	so	The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.	Waxa uu ugu faafitaan badan ayahy sadexda maalmood ee ugu horeeya kadib marka calaamaduhu soobaxayaan, in kasta oo ay macquul tahay in la isku gudbiyo wixii ka horeeya inta aan calaamado la yeelan. Qaabka caadiga ah ee lagu ogaado waa in qoraalka markaa ah ee jawaabta celinta polymerase (rRT-PCR) ee muunada duufka.	It is most widespread in the first three days after symptoms are emerging, although it is possible to transmit it before symptoms. A common pattern of diagnosis is that the then transcription of the polymerase feedback response (rRT-PCR) in the sample of the pad.
1879	en	so	It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

Isku gudbin mudo dheer ah xanuunka ah ayaa lagu sheegey badanaa dalalka dhamaan lixda deegaanka ee WHO ay ka shaqayso.	Long-term transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six areas where who operates.
1883	en	so	Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.	Caabuqyadaasi waxa weeye fayrusyada asxaanta u ah ama keena calaamada sida hargabka oo kale sida xumad, daal, iyo neefta oo qofka baqata.	These infections are viruses that cause symptoms such as colds, such as nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
1884	en	so	Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.	Calaamadaha soo baxaya waxaa kamid ah mushkilad neefsiga ah, laab xanuun joogto ah ama cadaadis, dawakhaad, lugaynta oo adkaata, iyo wajiga ama danbaha oo buluug noqda; waxaa lagu taliyaa in markaba la doonto daawayn hadii calaamadahani ay jiraan.

Kaalinta calaamadahan ay ku leeyihiin faafitaanka weli lama garanayo; laakiin, cadaymaha hordhaca ahi waxa ay sheegayaan in ay gacan ka gaystaan faafitaanka xanuunka.	The role of these symptoms in spreading remains unknown; But, preliminary evidence says it contributes to the spread of the disease.
1893	en	so	The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.	Tirada dadka calaamadaha yeeshaa inta ay ka yihiin dadka xanuunka qaada lama garnaayo wakhti xaadirkan oo daraasad ayaa lagu wadaa, Xarunta Xakamaynta iyo kahortaga Xanuunada Kuuriya (KCDC) waxay sheegtey in 20% dhamaan inta la xaqiijiyay ee xanuunado ay yeeshaan calaamado inta ay isbitaalka ku jiraan.	The number of people who develop symptoms while they are carriers is not known at this time and a study is being conducted, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed infections develop symptoms while in hospital.
1894	en	so	The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.	Gudida Caafimaadka Qaran ee Jayna waxa ay bilaabeen inay ku daraan kiisaska calaamdah leh kiisaska maalin kasta laga bilaabo 1 Abriil; oo 166 qof oo qaba caabuqa maalintaas, 130 (78%) ayaa yeeshay calaamado wakhtiga la baadhayay.	The National Health Board of Jayna has begun to include symptom-described cases in daily cases from 1 April; of the 166 people with infections that day, 130 (78%) had symptoms at the time of the survey.
1895	en	so	China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.	Xaakada iyo candhuufta qaar ayaa caaqi kara tiro badan oo fayruska ah.	Some of the infections and saliva can inginge large amounts of the virus.
1896	en	so	Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.	Candhuufta tirada badan sidaa waxay soo saartaa dhibco badan oo marka loo eego inta aan sidin ah.	The large number of spits thus produces more points than the non-sidin.
1897	en	so	Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.	Daraasad lagu sameeyay Singaaboor ayaa lagu ogaaday in qufaca aan waxba la saarin afka in candhuufsiisu ay u duusho ilaa 4.5 mitir (15 fuudh).	A study of Singaaboor found that the cough had nothing to do with the mouth that its saliva flies up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
1898	en	so	A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).	Inkasta oo fayrusku uu caariyan aanu hawada kusii jirin, Machadka Qran ee Saynisku waxa uu sheegey in isku gudbinta bioserosol ay macquul yahay iyo uruuriyayaasha hawada ee yaala barandooyinka banaanka qolalka dadku ay jiraan in laga heley fayruska RNA.	Although the virus is mild and does not exist in the air, the Qran Institute of Science states that bioserosol transmission is possible and the air collectors in the exposed cells in human cells have been diagnosed with RNA.
1899	en	so	Though the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA.	Nidaamyada qaar ee caafimaadka sida xanuunada neefsiga iyo wadnaha (CPR) waxay keeni karaan in neefta qofka laga soo saaro taas oo markaa keeni karta in hawada neefta markaa ah lagu kala qaado.	Some health systems such as respiratory and cardiovascular disorders (CPR) can lead to the removal of a person's breath which can then lead to the transfer of the air from the breath that is then.
1900	en	so	Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.	In kasta oo ay jiran walaacyo inuu ku faafo saxarada, khatarta tani waxaa loo arkaa inay yar tahay. Fayrusku waxa ugu badan ee uu ku faafi karaa waa dadka leh calaamadaha; inkasta oo ay macquul tahay in lagu faafiyo dadka aan calaamadaha lahayni, khatarta taasi way yar tahay.	Despite concerns about spreading to the stool, the risk of this is considered low. The most common thing the virus can spread is to people with symptoms; while it is feasible to spread to asymptomatic people, the risk of that is low.
1901	en	so	While there are concerns it may spread via feces, this risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while spread may be possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.	Xarunta Xakamaynta iyo Kahortada Xanuunada Midawga Yurub (ECDC) waxa ay sheegee in inkasta oo ayna cadayn sida ugu fudud ee uu u gudbi karto xanuunka, caadiyan halkii qof waxa uu qaadsiiyaa laba ilaa sadex qof. Fayrusku waxa uu meel ku dul noolaan karaa saacado ilaa maalmo.	The Center for the Control and Prevention of Diseases of the European Union (ECDC) says that while it does not prove how easily the disease can transmit, it usually infects two to three people per person. The virus can live on a place for hours to days.
1902	en	so	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.	Gaar ahaan, fayruska waxaa uu ku noolaan karaa kaadhadhka dushooda hal maalin, waxa uu ku noolaan karaa sadex maalmood caaga (polypropylene) iyo birta (AISI, 304) mudo afar saacadood ah ee 99% koober ah.	In particular, the virus can survive on the surface of the card for one day, it can survive for three days in plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI, 304) for four hours in 99% of the cup.
1903	en	so	Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.	Tani, laakiin, waxay kala duwan tahay waxayna ku xidhan tahay qoyaanka hawada iyo heerkulka.	This, but, varies and depends on the humidity of the air and temperature.
1904	en	so	This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.	Saabuunta iyo taydha ayaa sidoo kale saameeya hadii si sax ah loo isticmaalo; saabuuntu waxay burburisaa duxda fayruska ee xaga sare ka ilaaliya, iyo sidoo kale waxay ka saartaa maqaarka iyo meelaha uu saaran yahay.	Soaps and tays are also affected if they are used correctly; soap breaks down the virus's fat that protects it from the top, as well as removes it from the skin and its on-board surfaces.
1905	en	so	Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, deactivating it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.	Xal kale ayaa ah, sida benzalkonium chloride iyo chlorhexidine gluconate (jeermis dile), kaas oo waxtarkiisu uu yar yahay. Daraasad Hong Kong lagu qabtay, muunada candhuufta iyada oo la qaadanayo dawooin mudo laba maalmood ah kadib markii isbitaalka la is dhigay.	Another solution is, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (disinfectants), which is less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples by taking medication for two days after being hospitalized.
1906	en	so	Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken a median of two days after the start of hospitalization.	Shan ilaa lix bukaan, muunada kowaad waxaa lagu arkay xadi fayrus oo aad u badan, bukaanka lixaad waxaa lagu arkay inuu ka xadi fayrus badan yahay maalintii labaad ee la baadhay.	In five to six patients, the first sample found a high viral overdose, and the sixth patient was found to be more virulent than the second day of the survey.
1907	en	so	In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.	Xanuunka aadka u daran ee neefsiga coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) waxaa weeye xanuun aad u faran oo coronavirus novel ah oo neefsiga ah, sadexda qof ee ugu horeeyay ee aysoleeshinka la geliyay waxa ay qabeen xanuunada sanbabka oo isku xidhan oo xanuun neefsiga ah oo aad u daran ah oo Wuhan ah.	Coronavirus 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus respiration disorder, and the first three people admitted to the coronavirus had intertwined lung disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan.
1908	en	so	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.

Outside of the human body, the virus is killed in the soap used at home, which explodes from a protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
1910	en	so	Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.	Sanbabku waa unuga ugu badan ee uu saameeyo COVID-19 maadaama oo fayrusku uu ka geli karo unuga enzyme angiotensin-oo uu u badalo enzyme 2 (ACE2), kaas oo ku badan nooca II alveolar unuga ah ee sanbabka.	The lungs are the cells most affected by COVID-19 as the virus can enter the cells of the enzyme angiotensin—and convert it to enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is more common in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
1911	en	so	The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.	"Fayrusku waxa uu isticmaalaa meelaha sare glycoprotein oo loo yaqaan ""korodh"" (peplomer) si uu ugu xidhmo ACE2 iyo unuga qaabila oo dhan."	"The virus uses high areas glycoprotein called ""increase"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and the whole host cell."
1912	en	so	"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell."	Dhaawaca daran ee wadnaha waxaa lagu arkaa 12% dadka uu ku dhacay ee la dhigay isbitaalka Wuhan, Jayna, oo waxaana uu aad ugu badan yahay xanuunka aadka u daran.	Severe heart damage is seen in 12% of those infected and admitted to Wuhan Hospital, Jayna, and it is very common in extreme pain.
1913	en	so	Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted in hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.	Xadiga xanuunka wadna ayaa ku badan, taas oo keena in uu olol yimaado jawaab celin ah oo uu khalkhalo nidaamka difaacu inta uu socdo, laakiin dhaawaca myocardial ee daran waxa uu sidoo kale la xidhiidhi karaa ACE2 qaadaha wadnaha.	The amount of heart disease is more common, which causes a flame to come up in response and disrupt the immune system during the process, but severe myocardial damage can also be associated with ACE2 in the heart carrier.
1914	en	so	Rates of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.	Qaadaha ACE2 waxa aad loogu arkaa wadnaha oo waxaa kamid ah inuu wadnuhu shaqada joojiyo.	Ace2 is most commonly seen in the heart, including stopping the heart from functioning.
1915	en	so	ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.	Korodh imaatinta thrombosis (31%) iyo venous thromboembolis (25%) ayaa lagu arkay bukaanka ICU ee qaba xanuunka COVID-19 oo waxa uuna la xidhiidhi karaa caafimaadkooda liita. Shaybaadhka wax ku ool ah ee lagu sameeyay dadka u dhintay COVID-19 waxaa lagu ogaaday inuu waxyeelay alveolar (DAD), iyo oo lymphocyte uu ku jiro gubasho filter garayn ah ee sanbabka.	Increased arrival of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboemboembolis (25%) were seen in ICU patients with COVID-19 and can be linked to their poor health. Effective testing of people who have died of COVID-19 was found to have damaged alveolar (DAD), and whose lymphocyte contained a filter burn in the lungs.
1916	en	so	A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.	Inkasta oo SARS-COV-2 uu leeyahay tropism ACE2-sheegitaanka unuga epithelial ee la socodka neefsiga, bukaanka qaba COVID-19 aad u daran calaamadaha ah ee nidaamka kacsanaanta ololka.	Although SARS-COV-2 has ACE2 tropism-reporting epithelial cells in respiratory monitoring, patients with COVID-19 are severely symptomatic of the flame respiration system.
