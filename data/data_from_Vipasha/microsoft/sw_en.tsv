127	en	sw	The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).	Masuala ya sasa katika matukio ya visa vya COVID-19 katika siku 14 zilizopunguzwa katika nchi za EU/EEA na Uingereza kwa jumla yalifuata yale ya Mkoa wa Hubei (China) (Picha ya 1).	Current trends in the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the 14 days reduced in the EU/EEA countries and the UK overall followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
128	en	sw	For the EU/EEA and the UK overall, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).	Kwa EU/EEA na Uingereza kijumla, jumla ya matukio ya COVID-19 yalianza kuongezeka mnamo tarehe 21 Februari na kuongezeka zaidi tarehe 28 Februari 2020 (Andiko la ziada).	For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total number of COVID-19 cases began to rise on 21 February and rose further on 28 February 2020 (Additional Text).
129	en	sw	This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).	Hii iliendeshwa zaidi na ongezeko la idadi ya visa vilivyoripotiwa kutoka nchini Italia, lakini kote katika nchi za EU/EEA na Uingereza zilionyesha masuala swa ya ongezeko la matukio ya jumla ya COVID-19 (Andiko la ziada).	This was mostly driven by the increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but across the EU/EEA and UK countries showed issues of an increase in overall COVID-19 cases (Additional text).

Matokeo yetu yanaonyesha kwamba idadi ya visa vya COVID-19 vilivyoarifiwa inaongezeka pakubwa katika EU/EEA na Uingereza.	Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases notified is increasing significantly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
133	en	sw	The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries.	Masuala yaliyotazamwa katika jumla ya matukio ya COVID-19 yalipendekeza kwamba janga hili kubwa linaongezeka kwa kasi inayoweza kulinganisha katika nchi zote.	The observed issues in the totality of COVID-19 events suggested that this major pandemic is growing at a comparable pace across countries.
134	en	sw	This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.	Hii ni licha ya nchi tofauti kuwa katika viwango tofauti, tofauti katika jinsi kila afya ya umma inavyokabiliana na uwezekano wa ufafanuzi tofauti wa visa katika nchi na taratibu tofauti za kuchagua wagonjwa ambao ni lazima wapimwe kwa uthibitishaji wa COVID-19, ikiwa ni pamoja na upimaji wa watu.	This is despite different countries being at different rates, differences in how each public health responds to the possibility of different definitions of cases across countries and different procedures for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19 verification, including testing of people.
135	en	sw	Early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.	Mapema Machi 2020, madaktari katika maeneo yaliyoathirika ya Italia walifafanua hali ambapo 10% ya wagonjwa wa COVID-19 walihitaji tiba ya kina na vyanzo vya habari viliripoti kwamba hospitali na vitengo vya kushughulikia wagonjwa mahututi tayari vilikuwa vimejaa pomoni.	In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive therapy and informed sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units were already full of pomon.
136	en	sw	Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).	Data kuhusu kulazwa kwa wagonjwa wa visa vya COVID-19 katika hospitali au kitengo cha kushughulikia wagonjwa mahututi kwa sasa zinapatikana kiwango cha EU/EEA kwa 6% na 1% ya visa mtawalia (data haijaonyeshwa).	Data on hospitalizations of COVID-19 cases in hospitals or intensive care units are currently available at the EU/EEA rate at 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
137	en	sw	They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.	Hata hivyo, zinapaswa kukusanywa kwa utaratibu maalum ili kutumika pamoja na data ya sasa ya uchunguzi inayoangazia idadi ya visa vilivyoripotiwa na idadi ya vifo.	However, they should be compiled in a special order to be used alongside current diagnostic data that covers the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
138	en	sw	A study performed in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.	Utafiti uliofanywa 2010-11 ulionyesha tofauti kubwa katika upatikanaji wa vitanda vya matibabu ya hali mahututi na ya wastani barani Ulaya, kuanzia 29.2 nchini Ujerumani hadi vitanda 4.2 kwa kila idadi ya watu 100,000 nchini Ureno.	A 2010-11 study showed significant differences in the availability of intensive and moderate treatment beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
139	en	sw	This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).	Hii inamaanisha kwamba nchi zinaweza kuwa na rasilimali chache au nyingi kuliko Italia (vitanda vya kulaza watu walio katika hali mahututi na matibabu ya wastani 12.5 kwa kila idadi 100,000 mwaka 2010-11).	This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (intensive care beds and 12.5 average treatments per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
140	en	sw	Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a &gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.	Hali za kimuundo zinazohusiana na kulemewa kwa uwezo wa kushughulikia matibabu, kukiwa na makadirio ya kila nchi iliyo EU/EEA na Uingereza ya maambukizi watu walio na COVID-19 waliolazwa hospitalini wenye hatari ya > 90% ya kupita uwezo wa vitanda vilivyopo kushughulikia watu walio katika hali mahututi, umetolewa katika sasisho la sita la tathmini ya hatari ya haraka kuhusu COVID-19..	Structural conditions related to overburdening the capacity to handle treatment, with estimates by each country in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom of infection people with COVID-19 hospitalized with a 90% > risk of exceeding the capacity of existing beds to handle people in critical condition, have been released in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
141	en	sw	Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.	Kwa vile visa kwa sasa vimejumuishwa katika maeneo fulani katika nchi za EU/EEA na Uingereza, na hospitali na vitengo vya kushughulikia watu walio katika hali mahututi kikawaida huduma eneo la idadi maalum, taarifa kuhusu visa na vitanda vya kulazwa kwa watu walio katika hali mahututi inapaswa kupatikana katika vitengo vya kihimaya vya Kutoa majina kwa ajili ya takwimu ya kiwango cha 2 (NUTS-2).	Since cases are currently included in certain areas in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically care in a specific population area, information about cases and beds for people in critical condition should be available in the Provisional Units for Level 2 (NUTS-2) statistics.
142	en	sw	The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.	Hali iliyopo nchini Italia na masuala yanayoendelea sasa katika nchi nyingine yanaonyesha kwamba janga kubwa la COVID-19 linaongezeka kwa kasi katika EU/EEA na Uingereza.	The prevailing situation in Italy and the issues currently underway in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly accelerating in the EU/EEA and the UK.
143	en	sw	Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.	Nchi, hospitali na vitengo vya kushughulikia wagonjwa mahututi hivyo vinapaswa kujiandaa kwa hali ya kuendelea kwa maenezi ya kijumuiya ya SARS-CoV-2 na ongezeko la idadi ya wagonjwa wa COVID-19 wanaohitaji tiba na hasa matibatu ya watu walio katika hali mahututi, kama vile inayofanyika katika maeneo yaliyoathirika ya Italia.	Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of treatment and especially treatment of people in critical condition, such as that in the affected areas of Italy.
144	en	sw	As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.	Kama ilivyodokezwa katika tathmini ya hivi majuzi ya hatari ya kasi ya ECDC, mwelekeo wa haraka, unaohusisha watu na tondoti ni muhimu katika kuchelewesha kuenea kwa SARS-COV-2, kukiwa na mabadiliko kutoka mtazamo wa kiudhibiti hadi wa kukabiliana, kwa vile ongezeko linalotarajiwa la idadi ya visa huenda lisiwape wafanya maamuzi na hospitali muda wa kutosha kuelewa, kukubali na kuweka mikakati yao ya kukabiliana ipasavyo wasipotekeleza ipasavyo mapema.	As pointed out in the recent ECDC accelerated risk assessment, fast-tracking, population-based and tondoti trends are critical in delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a response perspective, as the expected increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and put their response strategies in place unless they implement them appropriately sooner.
145	en	sw	The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.	Tathmini ya hatari ya haraka pia inaorodhesha hatua za afya ya umma ili kukabiliana na athari za janga kubwa.	The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to deal with the effects of a major pandemic.
146	en	sw	There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.	Kuna nafasi ndogo ya fursa ambapo nchi zina uwezo wa kuongeza jitihada zao za udhibiti ili kupunguza kuenea kwa SARS-CoV-2 na kupunguza shinikizo kwenye matibabu.	There is little room for opportunity where countries are able to step up their containment efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on treatment.
147	en	sw	Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.	Kukosa kufanya hivyo, kuna uwezekano wa mifumo ya tiba ya afya ya nchini nyingine za EU/EEA kukabiliwa na ongezeko la wagonjwa wanaohitaji tiba ya kina ndani ya siku au wiki zijazo.	Failing to do so, it is likely that health treatment systems of other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in patients requiring intensive therapy within the coming days or weeks.

ARDS, uncontrolled burning, hydraulic assembly and continued swelling of nerves are in conflict with the gas overlap.
263	en	sw	Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.	Kutofanya kazi kwa mikamba ya hewa ya type-I na type-II hupunguza viwango vya mshtuko vya bidhaa oevu na kuzidisha viwango vya mshutuko wa eneo, hivyo kupunguza uwezekano wa mapafu kupanuka na kuweka hatari zaidi ya mapafu kukosa kufanya kazi.	The inactivity of the type-I and type-II air currents reduces the shock levels of wet products and increases the area's shock rates, thus reducing the likelihood of the lungs expanding and putting more risk of the lungs malfunctioning.

Dalili kuu za kimatibabu: Upimaji wa kifua na maendeleo ya muda ya dalili za kimatibabu zinapaswa kuzingatiwa pamoja na masuala mengine kwa ajili ya utabiri wa matokeo na matatizo ya COVID-19.	Major medical symptoms: Chest testing and the temporary development of medical symptoms should be considered along with other considerations for the prediction of COVID-19 outcomes and complications.
358	en	sw	Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.	Matumizi ya steroids: Ilivyofafanuliwa hapa juu, steroids ni vikandamizi vya kinga ambavyo hutumika sana kama tiba ya ziada kwa magonjwa ya kuambukizana ili kupunguza kiwango cha uharibifu wa kuchomeka.	Use of steroids: Described above, steroids are protective stimulants that are widely used as complementary treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the rate of burnout damage.
359	en	sw	Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality.	Kwa vile dozi ya juu ya dawa zinazopunguza kuchomeka kwa viungo zilitumika sana kwa wagonjwa wa hali mbaya ya SARS, wengi wa wahasiriwa waliugua kutokana na ukosefu wa damu kwenye mifupa na ulemavu ya muda mrefu na hali mbaya ya maisha.	As high doses of drugs that reduce organ insertion were widely used in patients of severe SARS conditions, many of the victims fell ill due to lack of blood in the bones and chronic disability and poor living conditions.
360	en	sw	Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.	Hivyo, ikihitajika, steroids zinapaswa kutumika kwa dozi ya chini na kwa muda mfupi kwa wagonjwa wa COVID-19.	So, if needed, steroids should be used at low doses and for short duration for COVID-19 patients.
361	en	sw	Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.	Msongo wa akili: Kama ilivofafanuliwa hapa juu, wakati wa mkurupuko wa COVID-19 wagonjwa wengi waliugua kutokana na mfadhaiko usio wa kawaida kwa vile walistahimili vipindi virefu vya karantini na hali ya shauku na wakaona vifo vya wanafamilia wa karibu na wagonjwa wenzao.	Mental Illness: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients fell ill from unusually severe stress as they endured long periods of quarantine and a sense of passion and saw the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.

Kulingana na utafiti wa kidemografia kufikia sasa, COVID-19 inaonekana kuwa na vipengele vya kiepidemiolojia tofauti na vya SARS.	Based on demographic research so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological features different from that of SARS.
364	en	sw	In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.	Pamoja na kuzalishwa katika njia ya chini ya kupumua, SARS-CoV-2 inaweza kuzalishwa katika sehemu ya juu ya njia ya kupumua kwa ufanisi na kusababisha dalili za wastani au kutoonyesha dalili zozote katika awamu ya awali ya maambukizi, sawa na virusi vingine vya CoV vinavyosababisha homa kali.	As well as being produced in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be produced in the upper part of the respiratory tract effectively causing moderate symptoms or not showing any symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoV viruses that cause high fever.
365	en	sw	Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.	Kwa hivyo, wagonjwa walioambukizwa katika awamu ya mapema au kipindi cha kuatamia wanaweza kuzalisha kiwango kikubwa cha virusi wakati wa shughuli za kila siku, kusababisha ugumu mkubwa kwa udhibiti wa janga.	Thus, infected patients in the early phase or inoculation period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily operations, causing significant difficulties for pandemic control.
366	en	sw	However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.	Hata hivyo, usambazaji wa SARS-CoV ulizingatiwa kufanyika wakati wagonjwa ni wagonjwa vibaya sana, ingawa usambazaji mwingi haukufanyika katika awamu ya mapema.	However, SARS-CoV distribution was observed to take place when patients are critically ill, although most of the distribution did not take place in the early phase.
367	en	sw	Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.	Hivyo, mkurupuko wa sasa wa COVID-19 ni mbaya zaidi na ni mgumu kudhibiti kuliko mkurupuko wa SARS.	Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.

SARS-CoV-2 inasambazwa zaidi kupitia kikohozi au kupiga chafya na pia inaweza kusambazwa kupitia kugusana moja kwa moja na vifaa viliyochafuliwa na virusi.	SARS-CoV-2 is mostly spread through coughing or sneezing and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus-contaminated devices.

A recent study for 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by infections inside the hospital, including 17 patients with other prior illnesses and 40 medical providers.
383	en	sw	Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.	Kwa hivyo, tahadhari kubwa inapaswa kuchukuliwa ili kuwalinda binadamu, hasa watoa huduma ya afya, wafanyakazi wa jamii, wanafamilia, wafanyakazi wenza na hata watu wengine wanaowagusa wagonjwa au watu walioambukizwa.	Therefore, great care should be taken to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers and even other people who touch sick or infected people.
384	en	sw	The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.	Hatua ya kwanza ya kujikinga inayoweza kutumika kupunguza hatari ya maambukizi ni kupitia kuvaa barakao za uso; kutumia barakoa za matibabu na barakoa za N95 za kusaidia pumu (matoleo ya # 1860) husaidia kudhibiti kuenea kwa virusi.	The first preventive measure that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing face coverings; using medical masks and N95 asthma-relief masks (versions #1860) help control the spread of the virus.
385	en	sw	Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.	Barakoa za uso za kimatibabu zinazuia matone ya majimaji kutoka wa mtu anayeweza kuwa ameambukizwa dhidi ya kusafirishwa hewani au kukwama kwenye sehemu za bidhaa, ambapo yanaweza kupitisha kwa watu wengine.	Medical face masks prevent liquid droplets from being infected from being transported into the air or stuck in product surfaces, where they can pass to other people.
386	en	sw	However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are approximately 85 nm.	Hata hivyo, barakoa za N95 pekee (matoleo ya # 1860) zinaweza kulinda dhidi ya kupumua ndani viini vidogo hata kwa vipimo vya 10 hadi 80 nm, huku 5% ya viini hivyo vikiweza kupenyeza kikamilifu; SARS-CoV-2 ni sawa na SARS-CoV kwa ukubwa na ni takriban 85 nm.	However, only N95 masks (#1860 versions) can protect against breathing into small germs even at doses of 10 to 80 nm, with 5% of them fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is approximately 85 nm.
387	en	sw	Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.	Kwa vile vipande vidogo vinaweza kupenyeza hata barakoa tano zilizowekwa pamoja, watoa huduma ya afya wanaogusana na wagonjwa lazima wavae barakoa za N95 (matoleo ya # 1860) lakini sio barakoa za kimatibabu.	Since small pieces can penetrate even five masks put together, health care providers in contact with patients must wear N95 masks (version #1860) but not medical masks.
388	en	sw	In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.	Pamoja na barakoa, watoa huduma ya afya wanapaswa kuvaa magwanda yenye vipengele hitajika ili kupuguza zaidi mgusano na virusi.	In addition to masks, health care providers should wear the required masks to further reduce contact with the virus.
389	en	sw	Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.	Virusi pia vinaweza kuathiri watu kupitia macho.	The virus can also affect people through the eyes.
390	en	sw	On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore an N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.	Mnamo tarehe 22 Januari 2020, daktari fulani aliambukizwa SARS-CoV-2 ingawa alivaa barakoa ya N95; huenda virusi viliingia mwilini mwake kupitia macho yake yaliyokuwa yakimwasha.	On 22 January 2020, a certain doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; The virus may have seeped into his body through his eyes that were lighting him up.
391	en	sw	Thus, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.	Hivyo, watoa huduma ya afya wanapaswa pia kuvaa vikinga uso vinavyoona au miwani wakiwa wanashughulikia wagonjwa.	Therefore, health care providers should also wear face shields or glasses while caring for patients.
392	en	sw	For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.

395	en	sw	Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.	Ingawa virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vilikuja kama virusi vipya kwa ulimwengu wa binadamu, kufanana sana kwake na SARS-CoV kama ilivyoripitwa tarehe 7 Januari 2020 kungepaswa kutoa tahadhari kubwa kwa China kutokana na kumbukumbu lao la mkurupuko wa SARS wa 2003.	Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus came as a new virus to the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV as it was called on 7 January 2020 should have drawn great attention to China given their reference to the 2003 SARS outbreak.

However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control comforted the public by saying that the new virus has low infection rates and low ability to produce from person to person and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
397	en	sw	This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at its minimal scale in Wuhan.	Ujumbe huu ulipunguza pakubwa wasiwasi wa umma, haswa wakati nchi nzima ilikuwa ikijiandaa kwa Tamasha la Spring, na walikosa kukabiliana na ugonjwa huo wakati haukuwa umeenea zaidi Wuhan.	This message greatly eased public concerns, especially as the rest of the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they failed to deal with the disease when it was no longer more prevalent in Wuhan.

Kwa mfano, mashirika haya yanapaswa kuwa (1) makini zaidi yanapofanya matangazo ya umma kwa sababu kila neno lina maana kwa wananchi na linaweza kubadilisha mitazamo na maamuzi yao; (2) kuwa makini zaidi na kuchukulia hatua taarifa zisizo za kawaida kutoka katika kliniki kuliko kusubiri kupokea ripoti rasmi kutoka kwa madaktari au maafisa; (3) kuweka vikwazo zaidi ili kudhibiti uwezekano wa kutokea janga katika awamu yake ya awali kuliko kujaribu kuifariji umma na (4) mra kwa mara kutoa majaribio faafu zaidi ili kuongeza ufahamu wa umma kuhusu magonjwa ya janga na kujaribu kuboresha mfumo wa majibu ya jamii muda baada ya muda.	For example, these organizations should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word has meaning for citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more careful to react to abnormal reports from clinics than to wait for the receipt of official reports from doctors or officials; (3) impose more restrictions to control the possibility of a pandemic in its initial phase than to try to comfort the public and (4) MRA by consistently providing more effective experiments to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to try to improve the social response system time after time.

Kulinganisha na kutofautisha SARS-CoV-2 na aina nyingine sita za HCoV kumeibua mfanano na tofauti zinazovutia sana.	Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV strains has raised some very interesting similarities and differences.
522	en	sw	First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.	Kwanza, kipindi kati ya kuambukizwa na kujitokeza na kipindi cha kuwepo kwa ugonjwa wa HCoV ni sawa.	First, the period between infection and emergence and the period of presence of HCoV disease are the same.
523	en	sw	In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.	Kutokana na hili, virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 hufuata hali inayovuma ya kawaida ya virusi vingine vya HCoV.	Due to this, the SARS-CoV-2 virus follows the trending normality of other HCoV viruses.
524	en	sw	Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).	Pili, uzito wa dalili za COVID-19 huwa kati ya SARS-CoV na virusi vinne vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii (yaani. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 na HCoV-NL63).	Second, the seriousness of COVID-19 symptoms tends to be between SARS-CoV and the four HCoV viruses being transmitted socially (ie. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
525	en	sw	On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.	Kwa upande mmoja, maambukizi ya SARS-CoV-2 huonyesha sifa ambazo kwa kawaida huonekana wakati wa maambukizi ya virusi vya kuambukizana kijamii vya HCoV, ikiwa ni pamoja na kuonyesha dalili zisizo mahususi, kiasi au hata kutokuwepo kwa dalili zozote.	On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits traits typically seen during the transmission of the HCoV social contagion virus, including showing nonspecific symptoms, moderation or even absence of any symptoms.
526	en	sw	On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.	Kwa upande mwingine, kijikundi kidogo cha visa kali vya COVID-19 pia kinaweza kuonekana kama ilivyo katika kisa cha maambukizi ya SARS-CoV, ingawa vipimo ni vya chini zaidi.	On the other hand, a small cluster of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in a case of SARS-CoV infection, although the tests are much lower.
527	en	sw	Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.	Tatu, usambazaji wa SARS-COV-2 pia unaonyesha ruwaza ya kuvutia ya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijumuiya na SARS-CoV.	Third, the distribution of SARS-COV-2 also shows an interesting pattern of HCoV distributed communally by SARS-CoV.
528	en	sw	On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.	Kwa upande mmoja, uwezo wa kusambazwa kwa SARS-CoV-2 angalau uko juu kama ule wa virusi vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii.	On the one hand, the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission is at least as high as that of the socially-transmitted HCoV virus.
529	en	sw	On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.	Kwa upande mwingine, itasalia kuthibitishwa iwapo uwezo wa kusambazwa kwa ugonjwa wa SARS-COV-2 hupungua baada ya kupitishwa kwa binadamu kama ilivyo katika visa vya SARS-CoV na MERS-CoV.	On the other hand, it will remain to be determined whether the potential for SARS-COV-2 transmission decreases after human adoption as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
530	en	sw	Finally, same as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.	Hatimaye, sawa na virusi vingine vya HCoV, virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vinaweza kugunduliwa kwenye sampuli ya kinyesi.	Finally, similar to other HCoV viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected in a stool sample.
531	en	sw	Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.	Iwapo kusambazwa kwa SARS-CoV-2 kupitia kinyesi kwenye midomo huwa na jukumu muhimu kama ilivyo katika kisa cha SARS-CoV angalau chini ya hali fulani kunasalia kuwekwa wazi kupitia utafiti wa siku zijazo.	Whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through feces on the lips plays as important a role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances remains to be clarified through future research.
532	en	sw	It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.	Pia ni jambo la kuvutia kuona iwapo virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vinaweza kutokea kwa misimu kama ilivyo katika visa vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii.	It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 viruses can occur slang as in the cases of socially transmitted HCoV.
533	en	sw	Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.	Licha ya hayo, vipengele vya SARS-CoV-2 ikiwa ni pamoja na uwezo wa kusambazwa, uwezo wa kuambukiza na kuendelea kusambaa baada ya kupitishwa kwa binadamu vitakuwa na ushawishi kwenye hatima ya mkurupuko unaoendelea wa COVID-19.	Despite this, SARS-CoV-2 features including the ability to be transmitted, the ability to infect and continue to spread after human adoption will have an influence on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
534	en	sw	All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.	Virusi vyote vinne vya HCoVs vinavyosambazwa kijamii vinavyosababisha dalili za wastani vimezoea binadamu.	All four of the socially-transmitted HCoVs viruses that cause mild symptoms have been adapted to humans.
535	en	sw	From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.	Kwa mtazamo mwingine, pia huenda ikawa ni ukweli kwamba binadamu wamezoea virusi hivi vinne vya HCoV.	From another perspective, it may also be the fact that humans are accustomed to these four HCoV viruses.
536	en	sw	In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.	Yaani, huenda wote wakawa wasaliaji wa majanga ya zamani ya HCoV.	That is, they may all be survivors of past HCoV tragedies.
537	en	sw	HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.	Virusi vya HCoV vinavyosababisha magonjwa kali kwa binadamu na binadamu waliopata magonjwa kali ya HCoV wameondolewa.	HCoV viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who have acquired severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
538	en	sw	For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.	Ndio hii ifanyike, virusi vya HCoV lazima vizalishwe ndani ya binadamu kwa kiwango toshelevu cha kuruhusu mkusanyiko wa mabadiliko yanayoweza kupambana na vigezo vya udhibiti vya mbebaji virusi.	Yes this is to be done, the HCoV virus must be produced in humans at a sufficient rate to allow for a collection of mutations that can combat the regulatory parameters of the virus carrier.
539	en	sw	In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.	Kwa mantiki hii, kadri mkurupuko wa SARS-CoV-2 unavyondelea na jinsi watu zaidi wanavyoambukizwa, ndivyo kuna uwezekano mkuu kwamba utazoeleka kwa binadamu.	In this sense, the more the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak develops and the more people are infected, the more likely it will be to humans.
540	en	sw	If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.	Ikiwa virusi hivi vitazoeleka vyema, uenezi wake kwa binadamu unaweza kuwa vigumu kudhibiti kupitia karantini au hatua zingine za kudhibiti maambukizi.	If the virus is well-adapted, its spread to humans can be difficult to control through quarantine or other infection control measures.
541	en	sw	For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.	Kwa miaka mingi, virusi vinne vya CoV vinavyoenezwa kijamii vimesambaa miongoni mwa watu, na kuchochea homa ya kawaida miongoni mwa watu/wanyama walio na kinga thabiti.	Over the years, four socially transmitted CoV viruses have circulated among people, fueling the common cold among people/animals with strong immune systems.
542	en	sw	These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.	Virusi hivi havihitaji hifadhi ndani ya mnyama.	This virus does not need shelter inside the animal.
543	en	sw	In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.	Kinyume chake, virusi vya SARS-CoV na MERS-CoV ambavyo husambazwa zaidi havijazoeleka vyema kwa binadamu na uenezi wake miongoni mwa binadamu hauwezi kudhibitiwa.	On the contrary, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses that are most commonly transmitted are not well-adapted to humans and their spread among humans cannot be controlled.
544	en	sw	They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.	Vinahitaji kudumisha na kuendeleza hifadhi zao ndani ya wanyama na kutafuta nafasi ya kusambaa kwa wanadamu wanaolengwa walio hatarini, pengine kupitia kibebaji cha pili na kinachoeneza.	They need to maintain and sustain their reservoirs within animals and find room to spread to vulnerable target humans, perhaps through a second and spreading carrier.
545	en	sw	SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.	Virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vina sifa sawa na za virusi vya SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV na HCoV nne vinavyosambazwa kijamii.	The SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same characteristics as that of the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV virus with four socially transmitted HCoV.
546	en	sw	It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.	Vina uwezekano mkubwa wa kusambazwa kama vile virusi vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii, angalau kwa sasa.	They are more likely to be transmitted as the socially-transmitted HCoV virus, at least for now.
547	en	sw	However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.	Hata hivyo, inasababisha ugonjwa kuliko virusi vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii na uwezo wake wa kusababisha ugonjwa ni wa chini kuliko SARS-CoV au MERS-CoV.	However, it causes disease than the socially transmitted HCoV virus and its ability to cause disease is lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
548	en	sw	It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.	Itasalia kuonekana iwapo vitazoeleka kikamilifu kwa binadamu na kusambaa ndani ya binadamu bila hifadhi au mnyama mbebaji.	It will remain to be seen whether it will be fully normalized in humans and spread into humans without a shelter or a carrier animal.
549	en	sw	Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.	Kabla ya kujadili asili zinazotokana na wanyama za HCoV, itakuwa vyema kwetu kujadili ufafanuzi na sifa za kibebaji cha kiukuaji, asilia,hifadhi na mbebaji wa uenezi wa HCoV.	Before discussing the animal-derived origins of HCoV, it would be advisable for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the promoter, nature, reservoir and carrier of HCoV propagation.
550	en	sw	An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.	Mnyama hutumika kama kibebaji cha HCoV cha kiukuaji ikiwa amehifadhi ukoo wa karibu unaofanana katika kiwango cha mfululizo wa nukliotidi.	An animal serves as a developmental HCoV carrier if it has retained a closely matched lineage at the level of the nuclear series.
551	en	sw	The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.	Virusi vya kiukoo kwa kawaida vimezoeleka na havina uwezo wa kusababisha ugonjwa ndani ya mbebaji huyu.	Viruses are naturally common and have no ability to cause disease within this carrier.
552	en	sw	Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.	Vilevile, mbebaji ambaye ni hifadhi huwa na HCoV kila mara na kwa muda mrefu.	Similarly, a carrier that is a reservoir tends to have HCoV consistently and for a long time.
553	en	sw	In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.	Katika hali zote, vibebaji virusi huambukizwa kiasilia na ni wabebaji asili wa HCoV au virusi vyake ambavyo ni vizazi.	In all cases, virus carriers are transmitted naturally and are the natural carriers of HCoV or its viruses that are generations.
554	en	sw	In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.	Kinyume chake, ikiwa virusi vya HCoV vimeingia kwa mara ya kwanza ndani ya mbebaji wa kati kabla au karibu kuingia kwake kwa binadamu, huwa havijazoeleka vyema katika mazingira hayo mapya na mara nyingi husababisha ugonjwa.	Conversely, if the HCoV virus has first entered the intermediate carrier before or about to enter it in humans, it tends not to be well adapted in that new environment and often causes disease.
555	en	sw	This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.	Mbebaji huyu wa kati anaweza kutumika kama chanzo kutokana na wanyama cha maambukizi kwa binadamu na hutekeleza jukumu la mbebaji msambazaji kwa kuruhusu virusi kuzalishwa na kisha kusambazwa kwa binadamu ili kuzidisha kiwango cha maambukizi kwa binadamu.	This intermediate carrier can serve as an animal-derived source of transmission to humans and performs the role of the transmitter carrier by allowing the virus to be produced and then transmitted to humans to increase the rate of transmission to humans.
556	en	sw	An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.	Virusi vya HCoV vinaweza kupitia maambukizi yasiyo na athari ikiwa haviwezi kudumisha usambazaji wake ndani ya mbebaji wa kati.	The HCoV virus can undergo an inadvertent infection if it cannot maintain its distribution within a central carrier.
557	en	sw	On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.	Kwa upande mwingine, virusi vya HCoV vinaweza pia kuzoeleka ndani ya mbebaji wake wa kati na hata kuunda hali ya ugonjwa wa muda mrefu.	On the other hand, the HCoV virus can also metastasize within its central carrier and even create chronic disease conditions.
558	en	sw	In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.	Katika hali hii, mbebaji wa kati anakuwa mbebaji asilia anayehifadhi virusi.	In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural carrier harboring the virus.
559	en	sw	Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.	Data ya kiepidimiolojia iliyofichua kwa njia ya kurudi nyuma kwamba faharasa ya kisa cha SARS kilikuwa na historia ya kutangamana na wanyama wa porini.	The epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the SARS case index had a history of contact with wild animals.
560	en	sw	Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.	Uchunguzi uliofuata wa kiwango cha maambukizi uliashiria kuwa wafanyabiashara ya wanyama walikuwa na kiwango cha juu cha anti-SARS-CoV igG ikilinganishwa na idadi ya jumla ya watu.	Subsequent studies of infection rate indicated that pet traders had a higher level of anti-SARS-CoV igG compared to the general population.
561	en	sw	Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.	Ngawa wenye uso wa barakoa (Paguma larvata) na mbwa wa rakuni waliomo katika masoko ya wanyama hai walitambuliwa kwanza kubeba virusi vinavyofanana na SARS-CoV ambavyo vinakaribia kufanana na SARS-CoV.	Mask-faced pigeons (Paguma larvata) and rakuni dogs contained in live animal markets were first identified to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
562	en	sw	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.	Hii iliungwa mkono kwa njia isiyo ya moja kwa moja na ukweli kwamba hakuna visa zaidi vya SARS vilvyoripotiwa baada ya kuuawa kwa ngawa wote waliokuwa sokoni.	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after the killing of all the wingers that were in the market.
563	en	sw	However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.	Hata hivyo, imeripotiwa kwamba ngawa wenye uso wenye barakoa kutoka porini au mashambani bila kutangamana na wanyama wanaouzwa sokoni wengi wao hawakupatikana na SARS-CoV, na kuashiria kwamba ngawa wenye uso wa barakao wanaweza tu kutumika kama wabebaji wa kati wa kueneza lakini sio hifadhi asili wa SARS-CoV.	However, it has been reported that mask-faced winged wingers from the wild or in the countryside without contact with animals sold in the market many of them were not exposed to SARS-CoV, suggesting that the mask-faced winged wingers can only serve as intermediate carriers of spreading but are not the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
564	en	sw	Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.	Itabainika kwamba, kwa vile 80% ya wanyama tofauti katika masoko ya Guangzhou wana antibodi zinazopambana na SARS-CoV, uwezekano kwamba aina nyingi za mamalia wadogo pia wanaweza kutumika kama wabebaji wa kati waenezi wa SARS-CoV hauwezi kupuuzwa.	It will be noted that, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have SARS-CoV-fighting antibodies, the possibility that many species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV spreaders cannot be ignored.
565	en	sw	All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.	Hawa wote wanaonekana kuwa wabebaji wasio na athari wa SARS-CoV.	These all appear to be untraceable carriers of SARS-CoV.
566	en	sw	Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.	Utafutaji uliofuata wa mnyama ambaye ni mbebaji asili wa SARS-CoV ulionyesha kuwa virusi vya CoV vinavyohusiana kwa karibu na popo, viitwavyo SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), vinavyopatikana ndani ya popo wa Kichina wa horsehoe.	A subsequent search for an animal that is a natural carrier of SARS-CoV showed that a CoV virus closely related to bats, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found within Chinese horsehoe bats.
567	en	sw	These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.	Popo hawa wana antibodi dhidi ya SARS-CoV na msururu wa jinomu wa SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.	These bats have antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
568	en	sw	This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.	Virusi hivi na vingine vya popo vya CoV huwa na msururu 88-92% unaofanana wa nukleotidi ulio na SARS-CoV.	This and other CoV bat viruses contain 88-92% identical nucleated sequences containing SARS-CoV.
569	en	sw	These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.	Utafiti huu umeweka msingi wa dhana mpya kwamba popo hubeba virusi vinavyoibuka vya binadamu.	This research has laid the groundwork for a new hypothesis that bats carry emerging human viruses.
570	en	sw	Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.	Virusi kadhaa vya Cov (SL-CoVs) vinavyofanana na SARS pia vimetambuliwa kwenye popo, lakini hakuna kati yavyo isipokuwa WIV1 vinavyoweza kutengwa kama virusi hai.	Several Cov viruses (SL-CoVs) similar to SARS have also been identified in bats, but none of them except WIV1 can be isolated as living viruses.
571	en	sw	Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.	Homoni ya binadamu inayosababisha shinikizo la damu inayobadilisha enzaimu 2 (ACE2) inafahamika kuwa kipokezi cha SARS-CoV.	The human hormone that causes hypertension that alters enzymes 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
572	en	sw	WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry.	Virusi vya WIV1 viliyotolewa kwenye sampuli ya kinyesi ya popo vilionyeshwa kutumia popo, ngawa na ACE2 ya binadamu kama kipokezi cha kuingia kwenye seli.	The WIV1 virus extracted from a stool sample of bats was shown to use bats, bats and human ACE2 as a cell-entry receptor.
573	en	sw	Intriguingly, sera of convalescent SARS patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1.	Cha kushangaza, seramu kutoka wagonjwa wanaopona wa SARS ziliweza kuangamiza WIV1.	Interestingly, serum from SARS recovered patients was able to destroy WIV1.
574	en	sw	Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.	Kufikia sasa, virusi vya WIV1 vinawakilisha kizazi cha karibu sana cha SARS-CoV kwenye popo, vikiwa na 95% za msururu wa nukleotidi unaofanana.	So far, the WIV1 virus represents the closest generation of SARS-CoV in bats, containing 95% of the corresponding nucleus sequence.
575	en	sw	Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.	Kwa mfanano mkubwa kati ya virusi hivi, inaaminika kwa jumla kwamba WIV1 si virusi vizalishaji vya kati vya SARS-CoV na popo sio wabebaji wa kati wanaohifadhi SARS-CoV.	With the strong similarities between these viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV and bats are not intermediate carriers harboring SARS-CoV.
576	en	sw	Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.	Uchanganuzi wa kifilogenetiki unaweka pamoja MERS-CoV kwenye kikundi sawa na virusi vya CoV-HKU4 vya popo na virusi vya CoV-HKU5 vya popo.	Phylogenetic analysis puts together MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 virus of bats and CoV-HKU5 viruses of bats.
577	en	sw	Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.	Virusi vya CoV-HKU4 vya popo na MERS-CoV hutumia vipokezi sawa vya mbebaji, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), kwa ajili ya kuingia kwa virusi.	The CoV-HKU4 virus of bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
578	en	sw	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.	Misururu ya RNA- tegemezi ya polimerisi ya RNA ya MERS-CoV inakaribia kufanana kifilojenetiki na iliyo ndani ya virusi vya beta-CoV vya popo vilivyotambuliwa barani Ulaya na Afrika.	The RNA-dependent sequences of MERS-CoV polymerases are almost identical in morphology to the domesticated beta-CoV viruses of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
579	en	sw	Up to now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.	Kufikia sasa, hakuna virusi hai vya MERS-COV vinavyoweza kupatikana ndani ya popo wa porini.	So far, no living MERS-COV virus can be found within wild bats.
580	en	sw	MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.	MERS-CoV na jamii yake ya karibu zaidi ya virusi vya CoV-HKU25 vya popo vina mfanano wa 87% tu wa msururu wa nukleotidi.	MERS-CoV and its closest category of CoV-HKU25 virus bats have only 87% similarity of the nucleated sequence.
581	en	sw	Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.	Kwa hivyo, popo huenda wasiwe wabebaji wa kati wahifadhi wa MERS-CoV.	Therefore, bats may not be intermediate carriers of MERS-CoV reserves.
582	en	sw	On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries.	Kwa upande mwingine, utafiti uliofanywa Mashariki ya Kati umeonyesha kwamba ngamia warefu zaidi kuwa na antibodi mahususi ya kusawazisha MERS-CoV, sawa na ngamia wa asili ya Mashariki ya Kati walio katika nchi nyingi za Afrika.	On the other hand, research conducted in the Middle East has shown that the tallest camels have a specific MERS-CoV balancing antibodi, similar to the camels of Middle Eastern origin present in many African countries.
583	en	sw	Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV.	Virusi hai vya MERS-CoV vinavyofanana na virusi vinavyopatikana katika binadamu vilitolewa kutoka kwa sampuli za puani kutoka kwa ngamia warefu zaidi, na kuashiria zaidi kwamba ngamia wanaweza kutumika kama wabebaji wahifadhi wa kweli wa virusi vya MERS-CoV.	A living MERS-CoV virus similar to the virus found in humans was extracted from nasal samples from the tallest camels, further implying that camels could serve as true storage carriers of MERS-CoV viruses.
584	en	sw	It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.	Pia ni muhimu kukumbuka kwamba kwa kawaida dalili kiasi lakini zilizo na utoaji wa virusi kwa wingi kwa jumla zilionekana kwa ngamia walioambukizwa MERS-CoV kwa ajili ya majaribio.	It is also important to remember that usually mild but highly contagious viral emission symptoms were generally seen in MERS-CoV infected camels for testing.
585	en	sw	Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.	Ni dhahiri kwamba, ngamia walioambukizwa hutoa virusi sio tu kupitia njia ya kupumua lakini pia kupitia kinyesi, ambayo pia ni njia kuu ya kutoa virusi kutoka kwa popo.	Obviously, infected camels release the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through feces, which is also the main way to extract the virus from bats.
586	en	sw	However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.	Hata hivyo, maswali bado hayajajibiwa kwa kuwa visa vingi vya watu waliothibitishwa kuwa na MERS hawana historia ya kutangamana na ngamia kabla ya kuanza kwa dalili, na kuashiria pakubwa maambukizi ya binadamu hadi kwa binadamu au njia zisizojulikana za usambazaji zinazohusisha aina za wanyama ambao hawajatambuliwa wanaobeba MERS-CoV.	However, questions remain unanswered as many cases of people confirmed to have MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, suggesting significant human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
587	en	sw	SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.	Virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vina 96.2% za nukleotidi zinazofanana na virusi vya CoV RaTG13 vya popo vilivyotolewa kwa popo wa asili ya Rhinolophus affinis.	The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains 96.2% of the nucleides similar to the CoV RaTG13 bat virus given to bats native to Rhinolophus affinis.
588	en	sw	As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.	Kama ilivyo katika visa vya SARS-CoV na MERS-CoV, tofauti za msururu kati ya SARS-CoV-2 na RaTG13 ni kubwa zaidi hivyo haviwezi vikawekewa uhusiano wa kiuzazi.	As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much larger so they cannot be correlated.
589	en	sw	That is to say, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.	Hiyo ni kusema kwamba, popo huenda sio wabebaji wa karibu wahifadhi wa SARS-CoV-2 isipokuwa iwapo virusi vya CoV vya popo vinavyokaribia kufanana vitapatikana katika siku zijazo.	That is to say, bats are likely not the nearest carriers of SARS-CoV-2 preservers unless the bat's nearly identical CoV virus becomes available in the future.
590	en	sw	Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicative of a probable animal-to-human transmission event.	Inaweza kuchukuliwa kwamba, mnyama mbebaji wa kati wa SARS-CoV-2 anapaswa kuwa miongoni mwa aina ya wanyama wa porini wanaouzwa na kuuawa katika Soko la Jumla la Huanan Seafood, ambapo visa vingi vya kwanza vya COVID-19 vilihusishwa, ikiashiria uwezekano wa tukio la usambazaji kutoka kwa mnyama hadi kwa binadamu.	It can be considered that, the intermediate carrier animal of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where most of the first COVID-19 cases were associated, suggesting a possible transmission event from animal to human.
591	en	sw	Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.	Tafiti nyingi za hivi majuzi zenye unaozingatia misururu ya kimetagenomiki imeashiria kwamba kikundi cha mamalia wadogo walio hatarini wanaojulikana kama kakakuona (Manis javanica) wanaweza kubeba virusi vya jadi vya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2.	Numerous recent studies focusing on genomic sequences have suggested that a group of vulnerable small mammals known as kakaona (Manis javanica) can carry the traditional beta-CoV virus associated with SARS-CoV-2.
592	en	sw	These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.	Jinomeu hizi za CoV kutoka kwa kakakuona zina 85-92% ya msururu wa homolojia ya nukleotidi sawa na virusi vya SARS-CoV-2.	These CoV genomes from kakasee contain 85-92% of the nucleotide homology sequences similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
593	en	sw	However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.	Hata hivyo, pia vinahusiana kwa njia sawa kwa karibu na RaTG13 kwa takriban 90% ya utambulisho katika ngazi ya mfululizo wa nukleotidi.	However, they are also closely related to RaTG13 at approximately 90% of the identification at the nucleotide series level.
594	en	sw	They cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.	Hupangwa katika jamii mbili ndogo za virusi vinavyofanana na SARS-CoV-2 katika mchoro wa kifilogenetiki, moja yao ikiwa inashiriki kikoa sawa kipokezi cha kunata (RBD) sawa na SARS-CoV-2, kilicho na 97.4% ya mfululizo wa utambuzi wa asidi amino.	They are grouped into two sub-communities of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic diagram, one of them sharing the same sticky receptor domain (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, containing 97.4% of the amino acid recognition series.
595	en	sw	In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.	Katika ulinganisho ulio wazi, RBD za virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 na RaTG13 ni tofauti kabisa, ijapokuwa kiwango kikubwa cha upana wa msururu wa jinomu inayofana.	In a clear comparison, the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 viruses are quite different, although the greater the width of the corresponding genome sequence.
596	en	sw	An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.	Utafiti wa awali kwenye kakakuona waliokuwa wagonjwa pia uliripoti kugunduliwa kwa virusi katika sampuli za figo ambavyo, vilitokea kuwa na uhusiano na SARS-CoV-2.	Previous research on patients also reported the discovery of a virus in kidney samples that, in turn, was linked to SARS-CoV-2.
597	en	sw	This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.	Utafiti huu ulitumia mbinu tofauti za ukusanyaji na urekebishaji ili kuzalisha msururu nusu wa jinomu ulio na 86.3% ya urefu kamili wa jinomu ya virusi.	This study used different collection and calibration techniques to produce a half-genome sequence containing 86.3% of the total length of the viral genome.
598	en	sw	We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.	Hatuwezi kufungia nje uwezekano kwamba kakakuona ni mmoja wa wanyama wabebaji wa kati wa SARS-CoV-2.	We cannot rule out the possibility that kakasee is one of the central carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
599	en	sw	However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.	Hata hivyo, kwa sasa hakuna ushahidi wa kuunga mkono asili ya moja kwa moja ya kakakuona ya SARS-CoV-2 kutokana na tofauti za msururu kati ya virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 na virusi vya beta-CoVs vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 ya kakakuona.	However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct kakaona origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence differences between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the beta-CoVs virus associated with the SARS-CoV-2 copepod virus.
600	en	sw	In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.	Pia, umbali uliopo kati ya SARS-COV-2 na RaTG13 ni mfupi hata zaidi kuliko ule uliopo kati ya virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 na SARS-CoV-2 vilivyopatikana kwa kakakuona.	Also, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between beta-CoV viruses associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 found in cocoa.
601	en	sw	The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.	Njia ya ukuaji wa SARS-CoV-2 katika popo, kakakuona na mamalia wengine bado inasalia kutambulika.	The growth pathway for SARS-CoV-2 in bats, coyotes and other mammals remains to be determined.
602	en	sw	Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.	Ingawa mfanano wa juu zaidi wa msururu umepatikana kwenye RBD kati ya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 na SARS-CoV-2 vilivyopatikana kwa kakakuona, SARS-CoV-2 na RaTG13 vina mfanano wa juu wa msururu wa jinomu.	Although the highest sequence similarity has been found in RBD between SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 found in cocoa, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest similarity of the tooth sequence.
603	en	sw	It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.	Inakisiwa pakubwa kwamba kiwango cha juu cha mfanano kati ya RBD za virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 vinavyopatikana ndani ya kakakuona na SARS-CoV-2 hungozwa na ukuaji wa kimkusanyiko unaoletwa kwa msingi wa uteuzi.	It is widely estimated that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2 viruses found within the kakaona and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the accumulation growth that is brought about on a selection basis.
604	en	sw	A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.	Pendekezo kinzani linaunga mkono uunganishaji tena kati ya virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 vilivyopatikana kwa kakakuona na RaTG13 katika aina ya tatu ya wanyama wa porini.	The opposing proposal supports recombination between SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2 viruses found in kakakuona and RaTG13 in a third species of wild animals.
605	en	sw	As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.	Kama msukumo katika ukuaji, uunganishaji tena umeenea miongoni mwa virusi vya beta-CoV.	As an impetus in growth, recombination is prevalent among beta-CoV viruses.
606	en	sw	The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.	Uamuzi bado haujafikiwa kuhusu asili ya karibu ya SARS-CoV-2 kutoka kwa wanyama.	A decision has yet to be reached about the imminent origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
607	en	sw	Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.	Kando na uwezekano mkuu wa HCoV kusababisha magonjwa, asili ya HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 na HCoV-HKU1 kutoka kwa wanyama pia imefanyiwa utafiti.	Besides the high potential for HCoV to cause disease, the origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from animals has also been researched.
608	en	sw	Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.	Ushahidi wa kifilogenetiki unaonyesha kwamba virusi vya HCoV-NL63 na HCoV-229E huenda vilitokana na bat-CoV, huku virusi vizazi vya HCoV-OC43 na HCoV-HKU1 vikipatikana ndani ya jamii ya panya.	Morphological evidence suggests that the viruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat-CoV, while viruses genetically modified HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found within the mouse community.
609	en	sw	It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.	Imeripotiwa kwamba virusi vya bat CoV vinavyoitwa ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) vilivyogunduliwa Kaskazini mwa Marekani popo wa rangi tatu alionyesha uhusiano wa karibu na HCoV-NL63.	It has been reported that a bat CoV virus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-colored bats showed a close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
610	en	sw	On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.	Kwa upande mwingine, virusi vya HCoV-229E vilihusiana kigenetiki na virusi vingine vya bat CoV, vinavyoitwa Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, vilivyogunduliwa nchini Ghana, huku wanyama wadogo wa jamii ya ngamia pia wakishukiwa kuwa wabebaji wake wa kati.	On the other hand, the HCoV-229E virus was genetically related to another bat CoV virus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, with small camel animals also suspected to be its intermediate carriers.
611	en	sw	For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2.	Kwa uwazi, maarifa ya sasa kuhusu asili ya wanyama ya virusi vya HCoV vinavyojulikana yamewekwa kwa njia ya muhtasari katika mchoro wa 1 na Jedwali la 2.	For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoV viruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
612	en	sw	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.	Uchanganuzi wa kifilojenetiki umetoa ushahidi wa matukio ya usambazaji wa HCoV baina ya aina za wanyama katika historia.	Phytogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the incidence of HCoV distribution between animal species throughout history.
613	en	sw	When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.	Wakati virusi vya HCoV-OC43 vilisambaa baina ya wanyama na kuambukiza binadamu vikitoka kwa wanyama karibu mwaka wa1890, janga la maambukizi ya pumu lilishuhudiwa.	When the HCoV-OC43 virus spread between animals and infected humans from animals around 1890, the epidemic of asthma was witnessed.
614	en	sw	The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.	Historia ya usambazaji baina ya wanyama ya HCoV-229E si bayana.	The history of the inter-animal distribution of HCoV-229E is not clear.
615	en	sw	Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.	Virusi vya alpha-CoV vya popo vinavyohusiana kwa karibu na HCoV-229E vimepatikana.	An alpha-CoV virus of bats closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
616	en	sw	Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.	Kati ya virusi hivyo kuna virusi vya alpha-CoV vinavyopatikana kwa alpaca ambaye ni aina ya mnyama.	Among the viruses is an alpha-CoV virus found in an alpaca that is a type of animal.
617	en	sw	Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.	Mistari kadhaa ya ushahidi huunga mkono usambazaji wa virusi wa moja kwa moja kutoka kwa popo hadi kwa binadamu.	Several lines of evidence support direct viral transmission from bats to humans.
618	en	sw	First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.	Kwanza, binadamu wala sio alpaca ambao ni wanyama huenda walikuwa na mgusano na popo katika mazingira walioshiriki ya kiekolojia.	First, humans and not alpaca that are animals may have had contact with bats in an ecologically shared environment.
619	en	sw	Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.	Badala yake, binadamu wanatangamana kwa karibu na alpaca ambao ni wanyama.	Instead, humans are closely interacting with alpaca that are predators.
620	en	sw	Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.	Pili, virusi vya alpha-CoVs vya popo vinavyohusiana na HCoV-229E ni tofauti na havina uwezo wa kusababisha ugonjwa ndani ya popo, ilhali virusi vya alpha-CoV vilivyopatikana kwa alpaca vilisababisha mkurupuko wa ugonjwa wa kupumua kwa wanyama walioambukizwa.	Second, bat alpha-CoVs viruses associated with HCoV-229E are distinct and have no ability to cause disease within bats, whereas alpha-CoV viruses found in alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
621	en	sw	Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.	Mwisho, virusi vya alpha-CoV vilivyopatikana kwa alpaca havijapatikana ndani ya wanyama wa mwituni.	Lastly, alpha-CoV viruses found in alpaca have not been found in wild animals.
622	en	sw	Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.	Hivyo, uwezekano wa alpaca kupata virusi vya alpha-CoV vinavyohusiana na HCoV-229E kutoka kwa binadamu hauwezi kufungiwa nje.	Thus, the possibility of an alpaca getting an alpha-CoV-related virus containing HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
623	en	sw	In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.	Hakika, popo ndio chanzo cha moja kwa moja cha virusi vinavyosababisha ugonjwa kwa binadamu ikiwa ni pamoja na virusi vya kichaa cha mbwa, virusi vya Ebola, virusi vya Nipah na virusi vya Hendra.	Indeed, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
624	en	sw	It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.	Kwa hivyo si ajabu sana kwamba popo wana uwezo wa kusambaza HCoV-229E moja kwa moja kwa binadamu.	So it's not too surprising that bats are capable of transmitting HCoV-229E directly to humans.
625	en	sw	Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.	Vinginevyo, ingawa virusi vya alpha-CoV vinatumika kama kikoa cha jeni cha HCoV-229E, alpaca na ngamia warefu zaidi huenda wanatumika kama wabebaji wa kati wa virusi wanaosambaza virusi kwa binadamu, hasa ilivyo katika hali ya MERS-CoV.	Alternatively, although the alpha-CoV virus serves as the HCoV-229E gene domain, alpaca and taller camels are likely to serve as intermediate carriers of viruses transmitting the virus to humans, especially in the case of MERS-CoV.
626	en	sw	MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.	Virusi vya MERS-CoV vinatumika kama mfano bora wa usambazaji baina ya wanyama kutoka kwa popo hadi kwa ngamia warefu na kutoka kwa ngamia warefu hadi kwa binadamu.	The MERS-CoV virus serves as an excellent model of transmission between animals from bats to tall camels and from tall camels to humans.
627	en	sw	The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.	Asili ya ukuaji ya MERS-CoV kutoka kwa popo inafahamika katika utambuzi wake wa kwanza na pia imethibitishwa na matokeo yaliyofuatia.	The growth nature of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its first diagnosis and has also been confirmed by subsequent results.
628	en	sw	It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.	Ni wazi kwamba popo hutoa mkusanyiko mkuu wa aina ya virusi kwa ajili ya mabadilishano baina ya wanyama ya visehemu za kijenetiki na usambazaji baina ya wanyama.	It is clear that bats provide the main collection of viral species for inter-animal exchange of genetic components and distribution between animals.
629	en	sw	Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'.	Uwezo wa kuishi kwa muda mrefu, makazi yenye wanyama wengi, miingiliano ya karibu ya kijamii na uwezo thabiti wa kuruka ni hali zinazomfanya popo kuwa 'mnyama anayeweza kueneza virusi'.	The ability to survive for long periods of time, dense animal habitats, close social interactions and a robust ability to fly are the conditions that make the bat a 'potential animal to spread the virus'.
630	en	sw	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.	Kwa upande mwingine, virusi vya MERS-CoV vimekuwa ndani ya ngamia warefu kwa muda wa miongo.	On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been in tall camels for decades.
631	en	sw	It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.	Vilizoeleka vyema ndani ya ngamia hawa ambao wamegeuka kutoka kwa wabebaji wa kati wa virusi hadi kuwa wabebaji thabiti na asilia wanaohifadhi virusi.	They were well versed within these camels who have turned from intermediate carriers of viruses to stable and natural carriers harboring viruses.
632	en	sw	MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.	MERS-CoV husababisha ugonjwa kiasi sana na hudumisha kiwango cha chini cha kubadilika ikilinganishwa miongoni mwa wanyama hawa.	MERS-CoV causes very much disease and maintains a low level of flexibility compared among these animals.
633	en	sw	Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.	Usambazaji wake wa mara moja moja kwa binadamu ni ajali na binadamu wanasalia kuwa wabebaji wa mwisho wa MERS-CoV wasioambukizana kwa sababu usambazaji wake hauwezi kudumu.	Its once-constant distribution to humans is accidental and humans remain the last non-infectious MERS-CoV carriers because its distribution is unsustainable.
634	en	sw	In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.	Kinyume chake, jukumu la ngamia katika usambazaji wa MERS-CoV, jukumu la kakakuona, ikiwa kuna lolote, katika usambazaji wa SARS-CoV-2 ni tofauti.	Conversely, the role of camels in the distribution of MERS-CoV, the role of cocoa, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 distribution are different.
635	en	sw	Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.	Hususan, virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyopatikana kwa kakakuona vina uwezo mkubwa wa kusababisha magonjwa ndani ya kakakuona.	In particular, the beta-CoV virus found in the kakasee has the potential to cause disease within the kakasee.
636	en	sw	They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.	Wanaweza kuwa ndio wabebaji virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2- visivyoweza kuambukiza, sawa na ngawa katika hali ya SARS-CoV.	They may be the carriers of SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2-infective viruses, similar to the wing in SARS-CoV conditions.
637	en	sw	Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.	Uwezekano kadhaa wa usambazaji wa SARS-CoV-2 baina ya viumbe kutoka kwa wanyama hadi kwa binadamu lazima uweze kukubalika au kukataliwa katika utafiti wa sku zijazo.	Several possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between organisms from animals to humans must be accepted or denied in future sku research.
638	en	sw	First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.	Kwanza, popo wanaweza kuwa wabebaji wahifadhi wa virusi vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 vinavyokaribia kufanana na SARS-CoV-2.	First, bats may be the host carriers of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
639	en	sw	Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.	Binadamu wanaweza kushiriki mazingira ya kiekolojia na popo kupitia uchinjaji au uchimbaji makaa ya mawe.	Humans can share ecological habitats with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
640	en	sw	Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.	Pili, kakakuona wanaweza kuwa mojawapo ya wabebaji wa kati wanaosambaza virusi ambao wamepata virusi vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 kwa mara ya kwanza.	Second, kakasee may be one of the intermediate carriers spreading the virus that has contracted SARS-CoV-2-related viruses for the first time.
641	en	sw	Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.	Binadamu hupata virusi kupitia kuchinja na kula nyama ya wanyama wa porini.	Humans catch the virus through slaughtering and eating the flesh of wild animals.
642	en	sw	It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.	Kuna uwezekano kwamba mamalia wengi ikiwa ni pamoja na wanyama wa nyumbani wanaweza kupata SARS-CoV-2.	It is likely that many mammals including domestic animals may catch SARS-CoV-2.
643	en	sw	A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.	Uchunguzi wa wanyama wa nyumbani na wa porini kwa ajili ya antibodi unastahiki.	Screening of domestic and wild animals for antibody is eligible.
644	en	sw	Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.	Tatu, kama ilivyotajwa hapa juu, kujumuishwa tena na kuzoeleka kwa SARS-CoV-2 huenda kulifanyika katika kiumbe cha tatu ambacho kilitangmana na popo na kakakuona.	Third, as mentioned above, the re-inclusion and normalization of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third organism that interacted with bats and cocoons.
645	en	sw	The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.	Utafutaji wa sili ya SARS-CoV-2 kutoka kwa wanyama bado unaendelea.	The search for SARS-CoV-2 from animals is still ongoing.
646	en	sw	Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.	Kando na aina tofauti za wanyama wabebaji, vigezo vitatu vikuu kwenye upande wa virusi pia ni muhimu katika kuwezesha virusi vya CoVs kusambazwa kwa viumbe.	Besides the different types of animal carriers, three main variables on the viral side are also important in enabling viral CoVs to be transmitted to organisms.
647	en	sw	First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.	Kwanza kabisa, viwango vyao vya juu vya kubadilika katika uzalishaji wa RNA.	First of all, their high levels of flexibility in RNA production.
648	en	sw	In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts.	Ikilinganisha na virusi vingine vya RNA moja, viwango vilivyokadiriwa vya kubadilika kwa CoV vinaweza kuzingatiwa kuwa “wastani” au “juu” huku kiwango cha wastani cha ubadilishanaji kikiwa ~10-4 kwa kila mwaka kwa kila eneo 2, kwa kutegemea awamu ya kuzoeleka kwa CoV kwenye mbebaji wake mpya.	"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rates of CoV fluctuation can be considered ""average"" or ""high"" with the average exchange rate being ~10-4 per annum per 2 zones, depending on the phase of the CoV's rearrangement on its new carrier."
649	en	sw	CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.	Virusi vya CoVs vina eksoribonuklisi ya udurusu, ambayo kufutwa kwake husababisha kuongezeka kwa uwezo wa kubadilika, kupunguza athari au hata uwezo wake.	CoVs viruses have a diffuse esophagus, whose deletion results in increased adaptive capacity, reduced impact or even its potential.
650	en	sw	Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.	Jambo la kupendeza ni kuwa, dawa ya nucleotide analogue Remdesivir inafahamika kudidimisha uzalishaji wa CoV kupitia uzuiaji wa eksoribonuklisi na RNA polimerisi inayotegemea RNA.	Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to degrade CoV production through the inhibition of e-polymerase and RNA polimerisi.
651	en	sw	Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.	Remdesivir ni mojawapo ya chanjo iliyo na uwezo mkubwa dhidi ya SARS-CoV-2 iliyofanyiwa majaribio ya kimatibabu.	Remdesivir is one of the most potent vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that have been tested in the field.
652	en	sw	Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.	Licha ya hayo, viwango vya kubadilika kwa CoV ni takriban mara milioni zaidi ya vile vya wabebaji wake.	Despite this, CoV conversion rates are approximately a million times higher than those of its carriers.
653	en	sw	In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.	Pia, viwango vya kubadilika mara nyingi huwa juu wakati ambapo virusi vya CoV havijazoeleka kwenye mbebaji.	Also, fluctuation rates are often high at times when CoV viruses are not normally present in the carrier.
654	en	sw	Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.	Ikilinganishwa na virusi vya SARS-CoV vilivyo na viwango vya juu vya kubadilika, viwango vya kubadilika kwa SARS-CoV-2 ni bayana kuwa viko chini, hali inayoashiria uwezekano wa juu zaidi wa kuzoeleka kwa binadamu.	Compared to SARS-CoV viruses with higher mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rates are clearly lower, suggesting a higher likelihood of human transmissibility
655	en	sw	Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.	Inaweza kuchukuliwa kwamba, tayari vimezoeleka kwa mbebaji mwingine wa karibu na binadamu.	It can be considered that they are already common to another carrier close to humans.
656	en	sw	In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.	Pamoja na SARS-CoV-2, hii pia hutumika kwa MERS-CoV, virusi ambayo vimezoeleka vyema ndani ya ngamia warefu zaidi.	Along with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, a virus that is best known within the tallest camels.
657	en	sw	Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.	Kinadharia, hakuna uwezekano kwamba mabadiliko ya kijenetiki yanaweza kufanya chanjo na dawa za kupambana na virusi dhidi ya SARS-CoV-2 zisiwe za kufaa haraka.	Theoretically, it's unlikely that a genetic mutation could make vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 less effective quickly.
658	en	sw	Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.	Pili, jinomu kubwa ya RNA kwenye CoVs ina uwezo zaidi wa kubadilika umbo katika urekebishaji wa jinomu kwa ajili ya mabadiliko na uunganishaji tena, hivyo kuongeza uwezekano wa ukuaji pamoja baina ya viumbe, jambo ambalo ni la manufaa kwa kuibuka kwa CoV mpya hali zikiwa zinafaa.	Second, larger RNA genes at CoVs are more capable of changing shape in the rearrangement of the genome for change and reconnection, thus increasing the likelihood of growth between organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when they are suitable.
659	en	sw	This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.	Haya yanaungwa mkono na fremu maalum wazi zilizo tele na utendakazi wa protini zilizosimbwa kuelekea mwisho wa 3 wa jinomu.	These are supported by special blank frames abound with the functionality of encoded proteins towards the 3rd end of the jino.
660	en	sw	Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.	"Tatu, CoV bila mpangilio na mara kwa mara hubadili kiolezo wakati wa uzalishaji wa RNA kupitia utaratibu maalum wa ""copy-choice""."	"Third, CoV randomly and periodically changes the template during RNA production through a special ""copy-choice"" mechanism."
661	en	sw	In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.	Ndani ya mbebaji virusi anayetumika kama chombo cha kuchanganyia, ubadilishaji wa strandi hufanyika mara kwa mara wakati wa kunakiliwa kwa CoV RNA.	Within a virus carrier used as a mixing vessel, strandi exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
662	en	sw	Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.	RNA zinazofanana zaidi za urefu kamili na za jinomu ndogo zinaweza kuungana tena ili kuzalisha COV mpya.	The most similar full-length and micro-chromatic RNAs can recombine to produce new COVs.
663	en	sw	Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.	Ushahidi wa kifilojenetiki wa uunganishaji tena asilia umepatikana katika HCoV-HKU1 na HCoV-OC43, na vilevile virusi vyaCoV vilivyopatikana ndani ya wanyama kama vile virusi vya SL-CoV ya popo na virusi vya CoV-HKU9 vya popo.	Morphological evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV viruses found in animals such as bat SL-CoV virus and bat CoV-HKU9 virus.
664	en	sw	Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission	Mwingiliano wa mbebaji virusi ukihusishwa na usambazaji	Virus carrier interactions associated with distribution
665	en	sw	Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.	Kando na vigezo vitatu vya virusi vilivyotajwa hapa juu, mwingiliano wa virusi vipokezi vya mbebaji ni kigezo kingine muhimu chenye ushawishi kwenye usambazaji baina ya viumbe.	Apart from the three viral parameters mentioned above, the interaction of carrier receptor viruses is another important parameter with an influence on the distribution between organisms.
666	en	sw	Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.	Hapa ndani, kuunganishwa tena kwa SARS-CoV kunazingatiwa kuwa mfano wa kawaida, ambao pia ulionyesha ushahidi wa uteuzi chanya wakati wa matukio ya usambazaji baina ya viumbe.	Here locally, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a classic model, which also showed evidence of positive selection during dispersion events between organisms.
667	en	sw	Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.	Kulingana na uchanganuzi wa kiulinganisho kati ya SARS-CoV ndani ya binadamu na ngawa, SARS-CoV inadhaniwa kuzoeleka haraka ndani ya wabebaji tofauti, hasa kwa mabadiliko katika RBD ya protini ya S.	Based on comparative analysis between SARS-CoV within humans and wings, SARS-CoV is thought to rapidly develop within different carriers, especially with mutations in RBD of the S protein.
668	en	sw	Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.	Kwa jumla, RBD kwenye protini ya S ya CoV huingiliana na kipokezi cha seli na huteuliwa kwa kina na jibu la antibodi ya mbebaji.	In general, the RBD on the CoV's S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is selectively selected by the carrier antibody response.
669	en	sw	In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.	Katika SARS-CoV, RBD ndiyo asidi amino ya 318 na ya 510 katika kipande cha S1, ambayo hunata ACE2 ya kibinadamu pamoja na vipokezi vikuu kwa ajili ya kuingia kwa virusi.	In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th and 510th amino acids in the S1 fragment, which sticks human ACE2 along with the main receptors for viral entry.
670	en	sw	The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.	RBD ya SARS-CoV ina uwezo wa kutambua vipokezi vya ACE2 vya wanyama mbalimbali, ikiwa ni pamoja na popo, ngawa, panya na mbwa, na kuruhusu usambazaji wa virusi baina ya viumbe.	The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of detecting the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, wings, mice and dogs, allowing for the transmission of viruses between organisms.
671	en	sw	In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.	Hakika, ni mabaki 6 ya asidi amino pekee ndiyo yalipatikana kuwa tofauti kutoka kwa virusi vilivyotengwa kutoka kwa binadamu na ngawa kwenye RBD na 4 kati yazo ziko katika sehemu ya kuunganisha vipokezi kwa ajili ya miingiliano na kipokezi cha ACE2.	Indeed, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be distinct from the virus isolated from humans by the wing on RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor linkage section for interfaces with the ACE2 receptor.
672	en	sw	Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.	Virusi vya SARS-CoV vilivyo ndani ya Ngawa vina mabadiliko ya K479N na S487T kwenye RBD yavyo, jambo linaloweza kuzidisha uwezekano wa mwingiliano wa protini ya S na vipokezi vya binadamu vya ACE2.	The SARS-CoV virus contained within Ngawa has K479N and S487T mutations on RBD, potentially exacerbating the potential interaction of the S protein with human ACE2 receptors.
673	en	sw	In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.	Yaani, ubadilishaji wa asidi amino hizi mbili unaweza kuwa muhimu katika virusi kuzoeleka kwa binadamu.	That is, the exchange of these two amino acids may be important in the virus being normalized in humans.
674	en	sw	It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.	Ni muhimu kukumbuka kwamba virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vina vipokezi sawa vya seli na SARS-CoV.	It is important to remember that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same cellular receptors as SARS-CoV.
675	en	sw	A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.	Tofauti ya 30% kati ya SARS-CoV-2 na SARS-CoV kwenye kitengo cha S1 cha protini ya S huashiria kwamba uwezo wa protini ya S kuunganishwa na ACE2 ya binadamu huenda umebadilisha.	The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV on the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the ability of the S protein to be linked to human ACE2 may have changed.
676	en	sw	Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.	Bila shaka, utafiti wa cryo-EM unaonyesha uwezekano wa mnato wa 10- hadi 20-zaidi wa mnato huu kuliko kati ya protini ya binadamu ya ACE2 na ya SARS-CoV S.	Of course, cryo-EM research shows a 10- to 20-fold likelihood of this necrosis than between the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
677	en	sw	It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.	Iitakuwa jambo la kuvutia kubaini iwapo vitambuzi vyovyote vyenza vinaweza kuhitajika kwa ajili ya usambazaji wa SARS-CoV-2.	It would be interesting to determine whether any enzymes may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

679	en	sw	There exist many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.	Kuna vipokezi vingine vingi vya HCoV, kama vile aminopeptidisi N vya HCoV-229E, na asidi ya kupambana na gluteni ya 9-O-acetylated vya HCoV-OC43.	There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptidisi N of HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-acetylated anti-gluten acids of HCoV-OC43.
680	en	sw	They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.	Vinaweza pia kusababisha ufanisi wa kuzoeleka kwa virusi hivi vya CoV kwa binadamu baada ya kusambazwa baina ya viumbe kutoka kwa wanyama wao wabebaji.	They can also lead to the effective transmission of these CoV viruses to humans after they have been transmitted between organisms from their carrier animals.
681	en	sw	In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.	Pamoja na vipokezi vya seli, matokeo ya usambazaji wa HCoV baina ya viumbe pia hutawaliwa na utegemezi na wabebaji wengine na vigezo vya uzuiaji.	With cell receptors, the outcome of HCoV distribution between organisms is also governed by dependency with other carriers and inhibition parameters.
682	en	sw	The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.	Tofauti ya protini hizi za wanyama wabebaji kati ya binadamu na wabebaji asilia wahifadhi wa virusi vya HCoV kama vile popo, ngamia warefu zaidi na wanyama wagugunaji huenda ukawa kikwazo kwa usambazaji baina ya viumbe.	The difference between humans and natural carriers of HCoV viruses such as bats, camels and lizards may be a barrier to the distribution between organisms.
683	en	sw	HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.	Ni lazima virusi vya HCoV vivamie vipengee vya utegemezi vya mbebaji virusi na kubadilisha vipengee vya uzuiaji vya mbebaji virusi ili kufanikiwa kusambaza virusi baina ya viumbe.	HCoV viruses must wear the dependent components of the virus carrier and change the virus carrier's inhibitory components to successfully transmit the virus between organisms.
684	en	sw	In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.	Kwa mintaarafu hii, vibainishi vya kimolekuli katika sehemu hii muhimu ya mwingiliano baina ya virusi na mbebaji wake bado havijatambuliwa na kuainishwa.	With this exception, the molecular determinants in this important part of the interaction between the virus and its carrier have not yet been identified and classified.
685	en	sw	An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.	Ukaguzi yakinifu wa kina wa mbebaji wa jinomu ulio tegemezi na vigezo vya uzuiaji vya SARS-CoV-2 kwa kutumia teknolojia ya aina yake ya CRISPR huenda ukazaa matunda.	A thorough inspection of the dependent genome carrier and SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory parameters using its own CRISPR technology is likely to bear fruit.

687	en	sw	The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.	Aina mbalimbali za bat CoV hutoa fursa tele za kuibuka kwa HCoV vipya.	The variety of bat CoV provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.
688	en	sw	In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.	Kwa mantiki hii, virusi vya CoV vya popo hutumika kama mkusanyiko wa jeni wa HCoV mbalimbali.	By this logic, the CoV virus of bats serves as a gene collection of various HCoV.
689	en	sw	In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.	Pamoja na hayo, kubadilika haraka na kuunganishwa kijenetiki pia huwezesha ukuaji wa HCoV na huwa hatua mbili muhimu katika mchakato huu.	Along with this, rapid adaptability and genetic connectivity also facilitate HCoV growth and become two key steps in this process.
690	en	sw	For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.	Kwa mfano, kupata au kupoteza jeni mpya inayosimba protini kuna uwezekano wa kubadilisha haraka sampuli ya virusi.	For example, finding or losing a new gene that encodes a protein is likely to quickly alter a sample of viruses.
691	en	sw	Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.	Miongoni mwa protini za ufikiaji za SARS-CoV, ORF8 imedhaniwa kuwa muhimu katika kuzoeleka kwa binadamu, kwa kuwa virusi vya SARS-CoV vinavyohusiana na popo vilitolewa lakini vikapatikana kusimba protini tofauti za ORF8.	Among the SARS-CoV access proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in human sequencing, since the SARS-CoV virus associated with bats was released but found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
692	en	sw	A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.	Sifa ya ufutaji wa nukleotidi 29 ya SARS-CoV imepatikana katika sampuli zilizotengwa mwanzoni mwa janga la binadamu.	Characteristic of 29 nuclear deletions of SARS-CoV has been found in isolated samples at the onset of the human pandemic.
693	en	sw	This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.	Ufutaji huu hugawa ORF8 ikawa ORF8a na ORF8b na inadhaniwa kuwa mabadiliko ya kuzoeleka yanayowezesha kubadilishwa kwa wabebaji virusi.	This deletion divides ORF8 became ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a reversible mutation of virus carriers.
694	en	sw	Besides, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.	Vilevile, SARS-CoV ina uwezekano wa kuwa na historia ya kuunganishwa na vizazi vya alpha- na gamma-CoVs, ambapo idadi kubwa ya maeneo madogo madogo ya vipengee vya kuunganishwa ilitambuliwa kwenye polimerisi ya RNA inayotegemea RNA.	Similarly, SARS-CoV is likely to have a history of connectivity with alpha- and gamma-CoVs generations, where a large number of small areas of connectivity elements were identified in the RNA-dependent polymerase.
695	en	sw	Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.	Maeneo ya kuunganishwa pia yalitambuliwa katika nsp9, nsp10 nyingi na sehemu za nsp14.	Convergence zones were also identified in nsp9, multiple nsp10 and nsp14 segments.
696	en	sw	Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.	Vilevile, imeonyeshwa kwamba janga la MERS-CoV lilishuhudia matukio ya uunganishaji kati ya vizazi tofauti, uliotokea katika ngamia warefu zaidi nchini Saudi Arabia.	Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic witnessed instances of convergence between different generations, occurring in the tallest camels in Saudi Arabia.
697	en	sw	Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which the HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.	Kando na SARS-CoV na MERS-CoV, matukio ya kuunganishwa tena kuwa aina nyingine ya HCoV yameshuhudiwa pia, ambapo HCoV mbalimbali huunganishwa tena na na virusi vingine vya CoV vya wanyama kwenye jeni zao zisizo na umbo.	Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, instances of recombination into another type of HCoV have also been witnessed, where various HCoVs are recombined and with other animal CoV viruses on their unformed genes.
698	en	sw	It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.	Tahadhari pia inapaswa kukumbukwa kwamba uteuzi wa bandia unaweza kuchangia katika mabadiliko yasiyonuiwa katika jinomu za virusi, mara nyingi kutokana na kuondolea virusi mashinikizo ya uteuzi, kama vile mfumo wa kinga ya mwili wa mbebaji virusi.	Caution should also be kept in mind that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, often due to the elimination of virus selection pressures, such as the immune system of the virus carrier.
699	en	sw	An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.	Mfano wa athari hizi ni kupotea kwa urefu kamili wa ORF4 katika sampuli awali ya HCoV-229E, kutokana na kufutwa kwa nukleotidi mbili.	An example of these effects is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the sample initially of HCoV-229E, due to the deletion of two nucleides.
700	en	sw	While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.	Huku ORF4 thabiti ikiwa na uwezekano wa kupatikana kwenye virusi vinavyopatikana kwenye popo na ngamia vinavyohusiana na HCoV-229E, virusi vya alpha-CoV vilivyopatikana kwenye alpaca vilionyesha kuwekwa kwa nukleotidi moja, kukisababisha kubadilika kwa fremu.	While stable ORF4 was likely to be found in viruses found in bats and camels associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV viruses found in the alpaca showed the placement of a single nucleus, causing it to change frame.
701	en	sw	Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.	Hatimaye, ukuaji wa virusi vipya vya HCoV pia hutokana na shinikizo la uteuzi kwenye hifadhi ya mbebaji virusi.	Finally, the growth of new HCoV viruses also results from selection pressure on the reservoir of the virus carrier.
702	en	sw	Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.	Kutokuwepo kwa dalili au dalili za kiasi ndizo ziligunduliwa wakati popo waliambukizwa na CoV, ikiashiria kuzoeleka kwa pamoja kati ya CoV na popo.	The absence of symptoms or temperate symptoms was the only one detected when bats were infected with CoV, suggesting a mutual co-occurrence between the CoV and the bat.
703	en	sw	It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.	Ilionekana kwamba virusi vya CoV vilizoeleka kwa popo vyema kimuundo na kiutendakazi wa mwili.	It appeared that the CoV virus was common in bats well structurally and functionally.
704	en	sw	For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.	Kwa mfano, hitilafu katika kukabiliana na hali ya kuchomeka ndani ya popo kulifanikisha kupunguza uwezo wa kusababisha ugonjwa kunaowezeshwa na CoV.	For example, a flaw in response to burns in bats achieved a reduction in the ability to cause disease facilitated by CoV.
705	en	sw	Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.	Vilevile, shughuli ya seli ya uuwaji asilia kwenye popo imedidimizwa kutokana na kuzalishwa kwa vipokezi vizuizi vya seli ya uuwaji asilia ya NKG2/CD94 na kiwango cha chini cha molekuli za aina ya I za mchanganyiko wa uoanifu wa tishu.	Similarly, the activity of the natural killing cell in bats has been weakened due to the production of the receptors of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell and the low level of Type I molecules of tissue compatibility combinations.
706	en	sw	Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.	Isitoshe, kiwango kikubwa cha aina za oksijeni tendaji (ROS) zinazozalishwa kutokana na shughuli nyingi mwilini mwa popo zinaweza kudidimiza mwigo wa CoV na kuathiri mapitio ya Eksoribonuklisi, hivyo kutoa shinikizo la uteuzi kwa ajili ya uzalishaji wa aina ya virusi vilivyo na uwezo mkuu wa kusababisha ugonjwa vinapoingizwa katika mazingira mapya.	In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) produced from excessive activity in the bat body can weaken the CoV and affect the review of Eksoribonuklisi, thus providing selection pressure for the production of the most disease-causing virus species when they are introduced into new environments.
707	en	sw	More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.	Sampuli zaidi za kusababisha ugonjwa za CoV zinaweza kukua kupitia uunganishaji tena, na kusababisha kupatikana kwa protini mpya au sifa za protini kwa ajili ya kuzoeleka kwenye mbebaji.	More disease-causing CoV samples can be grown through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein traits for recombinant in the carrier.

Hapa kuna siri kuhusu ni kwa nini wabebaji virusi wasio na dalili hupatikana na kinachosababisha visa kali katika maambukizi ya binadamu.	Here are some secrets about why symptomless virus carriers are found and what causes severe cases in human transmission.
712	en	sw	The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.	Dalili kali mara nyingi hutokana na kuchochewa sana na kinga ya mwili kupigana kupita kiasi na mlipuko wa saitokini ambapo kinga ya mwili likiwa thabiti sana, mapafu huharibika zaidi.	Severe symptoms are often due to being too stimulated by the body's immune system to fight over-zealous and a hysterectoin outbreak where the body's immune system is too strong, the lungs are more damaged.
713	en	sw	In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.	Kwa upande mwingine, katika wabebaji wasio na dalili, makabiliano ya kinga ya mwili hutenganishwa kutoka kwa uzalishaji wa CoV.	On the other hand, in non-symptomatic carriers, antibody confrontation is disconnected from CoV production.
714	en	sw	The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.	Mkakati sawa wa kutenganisha makabiliano ya kinga ya mwili unaweza kuwa na manufaa katika tiba dhidi ya SARS-CoV-2.	A similar strategy for isolating antibody confrontation may be useful in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
715	en	sw	The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.	Athari ya protini zinazotolewa na mbebaji virusi ni thabiti hususan kwenye popo.	The effect of proteins provided by the virus carrier is particularly robust in bats.
716	en	sw	Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.	Hivyo, utoaji wa protini zinazotolewa na mbebaji virusi za aina ya I angalau katika awamu ya mapema ya maambukizi ya SARS-CoV-2 katika binadamu kunapaswa kuwa na manufaa.	Thus, the delivery of proteins supplied by a virus carrier of type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
717	en	sw	In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.	Isitoshe, kuamilishwa kwa NLRP3 inflammasome kwenye popo huwa na madhara.	Furthermore, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats tends to be harmful.
718	en	sw	By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.	Kwa mantiki hii, uzuiaji wa NLRP3 inflammasome kwa kutumia MCC950 kunaweza kuwa muhimu katika matibabu ya COVID-19.	In this respect, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome using MCC950 may be important in the treatment of COVID-19.

Beta-CoVs viruses found in kakaona that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, this suggests that kakaona may be intermediate carriers or the beta-CoV virus found in kakaona may contribute gene fragments to the latter strain of SARS-CoV-2.

Evidence spanning across has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origins from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
727	en	sw	Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.	Kwa kuwa maambukizi ya SARS-CoV hutokana na kutangamana kati ya binadamu na ngawa sokoni, kufunga soko za wanyama na kuwauwa ngawa wote mle kungesaidia kungefanikiwa kukomesha janga la SARS.	Since SARS-CoV infection is due to human and sporadic interaction, closing animal markets and killing all the pigeons would have helped to end the SARS epidemic.
728	en	sw	By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.	Kwa mantiki sawa na hiyo, kakakuona wanapaswa kuondolewa kwenye soko la wanyama ili kuzuia usambazaji wa wanyama, kutokana na ugunduzi wa vizazi vingi vya beta-CoV vinavyopatikana kwa kakakuona vinavyohusiana kwa karibu na SARS-CoV-2.

It is important that continued investigation of animals to better understand the ecology of the CoV and their natural carriers, which will prove crucial in preventing transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
745	en	sw	To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.	Kuhitimisha, njia inayofaa zaidi ya kuzuia usambazaji wa virusi kutoka kwa wanyama ni kwa binadamu kukaa mbali na mazingira ya kiekolojia ya wahifadhi asilia wa virusi vinavyosambazwa kutoka kwa wanyama.

747	en	sw	First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.	Kwanza, ikiwa popo wanasambaza virusi vya kijadi vya SARS-CoV-2 kwa kakakuona, itakuwa jambo la kuvutia kuona ni katika hali zipi ambapo popo na kakakuona wanaweza wakapatikana katika mazingira sawa ya kiekolojia.	First, if bats transmit the traditional SARS-CoV-2 virus to the kakasee, it would be interesting to see in what circumstances the bat and kakaona could be found in the same ecological environment.
748	en	sw	Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.	Pili, iwapo popo wana nafasi ya moja kwa moja zaidi katika usambazaji kwa binadamu, inapaswa kubainiwa jinsi binadamu hutangamana na popo.	Second, if bats have a more direct place in the distribution to humans, it should be determined how humans interact with bats.
749	en	sw	Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.	Tatu, ikiwa mamalia wa tatu atatumika kama mbebaji halisi wa kati, inapaswa kubainishwa jinsi mnyama huyo huingiliana na viumbe wengine ikiwa ni pamoja na binadamu, popo na kakakuona.	Third, if a third mammal serves as the actual intermediate carrier, it should be determined how that animal interacts with other organisms including humans, bats and kakasee.
750	en	sw	Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.	Hatimaye, kwa kuwa wanyama wengine ikiwa ni pamoja na wanyama wa nyumbani wanaweza kuwa katika hatari ya kupata SARS-CoV-2, maambukizi ya kiuchunguzi na kimajaribio yanapaswa kuendeshwa.	Finally, since other animals including domestic animals may be at risk of developing SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic and experimental transmission should be conducted.
751	en	sw	Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future.	Ikiwa ni popo, kakakuona au mnyama mwingine, inatarajiwa kwamba SARS-CoV-2 au virusi vyake vizalishaji ambavyo vinakaribia kufanana vitatambuliwa kwenye wabebaji wake asilia katika siku zijazo.	Whether it's a bat, a coyote or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its closely resembling viruses will be identified on its original carriers in the future.
752	en	sw	Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.	Kuendelea kwa uchunguzi katika uwanja huu kutapambanua njia ya ukuaji wa SARS-CoV-2 katika wanyama, na athari muhimu ikiwa katika uzuiaji na udhibiti wa COVID-19 katika binadamu.

1704	en	sw	More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.	Kihususa, ushikamano wa protini ya SI ya SARS-CoV na SARS-CoV2 kwa kikoa cha mmeng'enyo cha ACE2 kwenye sehemu ya juu ya seli husababisha endocytosis na uhamishaji wa virusi na kimeng'enya kwa endosomu zilizo ndani ya seli.	Specifically, the coherence of the SI protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 digestive domain at the top of the cell leads to endocytosis and the transfer of virus and enzyme to endosomes located within the cell.

Hii imesababisha wengine kudhania kwamba kupunguza viwango vya ACE2, katika seli, kunaweza kusaidia kukabiliana na maambukizi.	This entry process also requires preparation of protein S and serine protein blockers main TMPRSS2, an inhibition that is currently being investigated as a possible treatment.
