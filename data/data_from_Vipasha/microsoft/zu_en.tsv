127	en	zu	The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).	Amathrendi esehlakalo esandayo esinqanyuliwe sezinsuku ezingu-14 zezimo ze-COVID-19 emazweni ase-EU/EEA nase-UK ngokuvamile alandele lawo ase-Hubei Province (China) (Umfanekiso 1).	Trends of the increasingly cut 14-day event of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries generally follow those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
128	en	zu	For the EU/EEA and the UK overall, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).	Sekukonke e-EU/EEA nase-UK, isehlakalo esandayo se-COVID-19 saqala ukunyuka cishe ngo-21 February futhi sanyuka kakhulu ngo-28 February 2020 (Isithasiselo sokufundwayo).	Overall in the EU/EEA and UK, the increasing incidence of COVID-19 began to rise on about 21 February and increased significantly on 28 February 2020 (Reading Appendix).
129	en	zu	This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).	Lokhu kwandiswa kakhulu ukwanda okusheshayo kwenani lwezimo ezibikiwe ezisuka-Italy, kodwa wonke amanye amazwe ase-EU/EEA nase-UK abonisa amathrendi anyukayo afanayo esehlakalo esandayo se-COVID-19 (Isithasiselo sokufundwayo).	This greatly increased the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries are showing similarly rising trends in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 (Reading Supplement).
130	en	zu	Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with that in Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.	Umfanekiso 2 ubonisa inani elandayo lezimo ze-COVID-19, emazweni ase-EU/EEA nase-UK uma kuqhathaniswa nalelo lase-Italy ngenkathi yango-31 January–15 March 2020.	Figure 2 shows an increasing number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to that in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
131	en	zu	It highlights that, as at 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks prior or less.	Ligqamisa ukuthi, ngo-15 March 8:00 a.m., amanye amazwe angu-15 ase-EU/EEA kanye ne-UK ayesevele ebike ingqikithi yenani elingaqhathaniswa nalelo lase-Italy emavikini angu-3 ngaphambilini noma kancane.	It highlights that, by 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total of numbers comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
132	en	zu	Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.	Imiphumela yethu ibonisa ukuthi inani lezimo ezibikiwe ze-COVID-19 linyuka ngokushesha e-EU/EEA nase-UK.	Our results show that the number of reported CASES of COVID-19 is rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
133	en	zu	The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries.	Amathrendi aphawuliwe kusehlakalo esandayo se-COVID-19 abonisa ukuthi ubhubhane luqhubeka ngejubane elifanayo kuwo wonke amazwe.	Trends noted in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 show that the pandemic is continuing at the same pace in all countries.
134	en	zu	This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.	Lokhu kwenzeka naphezu kokuthi amazwe esezigabeni ezihlukene, ukuhlukahluka endleleni yokusabela kwezempilo yomphakathi kazwelonke, futhi cishe nezincazelo ezingafani zezimo emazweni kanye namaphrothokholi ahlukene okukhetha iziguli okufanele zihlolwe ukuze kuqinisekiswe i-COVID-19, okuhlanganisa nokuhlola kokulandelela.	This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in the way of national public health responses, and almost different definitions of conditions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be screened for COVID-19, which includes follow-up testing.
135	en	zu	Early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.	Ekuqaleni kuka-March 2020, odokotela ezifundeni ezithintekile zase-Italy bachaza isimo lapho u-10% weziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19 zidinga ukunakekelwa kwezimo ezibucayi futhi imithombo yezindaba yabika ukuthi izibhedlela kanye namayunithi okunakekelwa okubucayi kulezi zifunda ayesefinyelele umthamo wawo ophakeme.	In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19 needed critical care and media reported that hospitals and critical care units in these regions had already reached their highest capacity.
136	en	zu	Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).	Idatha yokungeniswa kwabanezimo ze-COVID-19 esibhedlela kanye/noma iyunithi yokunakekelwa okubucayi iyatholakala esigabeni se-EU/EEA ezimweni ezingu-6% no-1% kuphela, ngokulandelana (idatha ayibonisiwe).	Data for admission of COVID-19 cases to a hospital and/or critical care unit is available in the EU/EEA phase in only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data is not shown).
137	en	zu	They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.	Kufanele, nokho, iqoqwe ngendlela ehlelekile ukuze ihambelana nedatha yokuqapha yamanje egxila enanini lezimo ezibikiwe kanye nenani lokufa.	It should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to match current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
138	en	zu	A study performed in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.	Ucwaningo olwenziwa ngo-2010–11 lwabonisa ukuhluka okukhulu ngokuqondene nokutholakala kwemibhede yokunakekelwa okubucayi kanye neyokunakekelwa okumaphakathi e-Europe, kusuka ku-29.2 e-Germany kuye emibhedeni engu-4.2 emphakathini wabantu abangu-100,000 e-Portugal.	A study conducted in 2010–11 showed significant variations regarding the availability of critical care and intermediate care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds in the population of 100,000 people in Portugal.
139	en	zu	This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).	Lokhu kusho ukuthi amazwe kungenzeka ukuthi anezinsiza eziningi noma ezincane kune-Italy (imibhede yokunakekelwa okubucayi engu-12.5 neyokunakekelwa okumaphakathi emphakathini wabantu abangu-100,000 ngo-2010–11).	This means that countries are likely to have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 critical care beds and average care in the population of 100,000 people in 2010–11).
140	en	zu	Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a &gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.	Ukulingisa izimo ezihlobene nokugcwala komthamo wokunakekelwa kwezempilo, okunikeza isilinganiso sezwe ngalinye lase-EU/EEA nase-UK ngokuqondene nokwanda kwezimo zabalaliswe esibhedlela ngenxa ye-COVID-19 okuhlobene nengozi engu-> 90% yokweqa umthamo wemibhede yokunakekelwa okubucayi, kunikezwa kusibuyekezo sesithupha sokuhlolwa kwengozi esheshayo ye-ECDC ngokuqondene ne-COVID-19.	Simulating conditions related to overcrowding of healthcare capacity, which provides an average for each EU/EEA and UK country in relation to increased conditions laid out in hospital due to COVID-19 related to the risk of > 90% overvaration of critical care beds, is offered in the sixth review of the ECDC's emergency risk assessment in relation to COVID-19.
141	en	zu	Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.	Njengoba izimo zinqwabelane ezifundeni ezithile emazweni ase-EU/EEA nase-UK, futhi izibhedlela namayunithi okunakekelwa okubucayi ngokuvamile kusiza abantu abathile besifunda, ulwazi olumayelana nezimo kanye nemibhede yokunakekelwa okubucayi kufanele kutholakale ezingeni le-Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (I-NUTS-2).	As conditions have contracted in certain regions in EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and critical care units generally help certain regional people, information about conditions and critical care beds should be available at the Nomenclature level of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
142	en	zu	The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.	Okuhlangenwe nakho kwase-Italy kanye namathrendi amanje akwamanye amazwe abonisa ukuthi ubhubhane lwe-COVID-19 lukhula ngokushesha e-EU/EEA nase-UK.	Italy's experience and current foreign trends show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
143	en	zu	Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.	Amazwe, izibhedlela namayunithi okunakekelwa okubucayi kufanele azilungiselele isimo sokuthelelana komphathi okuqhubekayo kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye nokwanda kweziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19 edinga ukunakekelwa kwezokwelashwa, futhi ikakhulukazi ukunakekelwa okubucayi, njengalokho okwenzeka ezifundeni ezithintekile e-Italy.	Countries, hospitals and critical care units should be prepared for the status of the manager's continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care, and especially critical care, as is the case in affected regions in Italy.
144	en	zu	As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.	Njengoba kuboniswe ekuhloleni kwakamuva kwe-ECDC kwengozi esheshayo, indlela esheshayo, enomdlandla neningilizayo ibalulekile ukulibazisa ukusakazeka kwe-SARS-COV-2, ngokwenza ushintsho olusuka endleleni elawulayo luye endleleni enciphisayo, njengoba ukwanda okusheshayo okulindelwe kwenani lezimo kungase kunganikezi abenzi bezinqumo nezibhedlela isikhathi esanele sokuqonda, sokwamukela nokuvumelanisa ukusabela kwabo kube indlela efanele uma kungasetshenzisiwe kusanesikhathi.	As demonstrated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a fast, ambitious and detailed approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making the transition from a controlled pathway to a reduced pathway, as the rapidly anticipated increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response to the right approach if not implemented in advance.
145	en	zu	The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.	Ukuhlola kwengozi esheshayo kuphinde kusho izinyathelo zempilo yomphakathi ukuze kulawulwe umthelela wobhubhane.	Rapid risk assessments also mean public health measures to control the impact of the pandemic.
146	en	zu	There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.	Kukhona intuba encane yethuba lapho amazwe engakwazi khona ukuba nethuba lokulawula ngokuqhubekayo imizamo yawo yokulawula ukuze kuncishiswe ukubhebhetheka SARS-CoV-2 futhi kuncishiswe ingcindezi ekunakekelweni kwezempilo.	There is a small gap of opportunity where countries cannot have the opportunity to continuously control their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
147	en	zu	Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.	Ukuhluleka kwalokhu, kungenzeka ukuthi amasistimu ezokwelashwa amanye amazwe ase-EU/EEA azobhekana nenqwaba yeziguli ezidinga ukunakekelwa kwezimo ezibucayi ezinsukwini ezizayo noma emavikini.	Failing this, it is likely that treatment systems in some EU/EEA countries will face a host of patients who need critical care in the coming days or weeks.

163	en	zu	CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.	Ama-CoV ngokuvamile ababhekwa njengama-pathogen angabulali kubantu, ngokuyinhloko abangela u-15% wemikhuhlane evamile 4.	CoVs are generally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, primarily causing 15% of common flu 4.
164	en	zu	However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.	Nokho, kuleli khulu leminyaka, sike sabhekana kabili nama-CoV abantu a-pathogenic kakhulu, okungukuthi, i-SARS-CoV ne- MERS-CoV, eyabangela ubhubhane olwaqala e-China ngo-2003 nase-Saudi Arabia ngo-2012, ngokulandelana, futhi ngokushesha asakazekela kwamanye amazwe okwabangela ukugula okubi nokufa.	In this century, however, we have twice dealt with highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused epidemics that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
165	en	zu	Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.	Ngakho-ke, i-COVID-19 yamanje iwukubheduka kwesithathu kwe-CoV kumlando obhaliwe wabantu.	Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third mutation of CoV in recorded human history.

Nge-MERS, ngokusekelwe kucwaningo lolwazi lwabantu ngo-June 2012, ukufa kwakungu-37% kubantu abagulayo abaqinisekisiwe abangu-2,494.	With MERS, based on a population information study in June 2012, deaths were 37% in 2,494 confirmed cases.
249	en	zu	An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.	Ucwaningo lokuqala lwabika ukuthi u-R0 we-SARS-CoV-2 wawuphakeme ngo-6.47 unesikhewu sokuzethemba (I-CI) esingu-95% kokungu-5.71-7.23, lapho u-R0 we-SARS-CoV wawunobubanzi obusuka ku-2 ukuya ku-4.	The first study reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was higher at 6.47 with a confidence gap (CI) of 95% at 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV had a range from 2 to 4.
250	en	zu	A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table ​Table1.1.	Ukuqhathaniswa kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ne-MERS-CoV kanye ne-SARA-CoV ngokuphathelene nezimpawu zabo, ukufa, kanye no-R0 kumelelwe kokuthi Ithebula Ithebula1.1.	The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is represented as Table 1.1.
251	en	zu	The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.	Izinombolo ezingenhla zisikisela ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 inekhono eliphakeme kakhulu lokubhebhetheka kune-MERS-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV, kodwa inamandla amancane okubulala kunazo zombili.	The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher ability to circulate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has less lethal potential than both.
252	en	zu	Thus, it is much more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.	Ngakho-ke, kuyinselele kakhulu ukulawula umqedazwe we-SARS-CoV-2 kune-MERS-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV.	Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
253	en	zu	Clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.	Ukuqalisa kwamaqoqo kuvame ukwenzeka kumndeni ofanayo noma kumbuthano ofanayo noma into yezokuthutha efana nomkhumbi wokungcebeleka.	The initiation of clusters usually occurs in the same family or at the same gathering or transportation object such as a cruise ship.
254	en	zu	Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.	Iziguli ngokuvamile zinomlando wokuvakasha noma zihlala e-Wuhan noma ezinye izindawo ezithintekile noma ukuxhumana nabantu abathelelekile noma iziguli emavikini amabili akamuva ngaphambi kokuqala.	Patients usually have a history of visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contacting infected people or patients in the last two weeks before starting.
255	en	zu	However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends out an alarm to increase the time for quarantine.	Nokho, kuye kwabikwa ukuthi abantu bangakwazi ukuthwala igciwane ngaphandle kwezimpawu isikhathi eside kunamaviki amabili futhi iziguli ezilashiwe ezikhishiwe esibhedlela zingakwazi ukuphinde zithwale igciwane futhi, okukhipha isixwayiso sokunyusa isikhathi sokuzivalela.	However, it has been reported that people may be able to carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and hospitalized patients may not be able to carry the virus again, issuing a warning to extend the quarantine period.
256	en	zu	Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.	Iziguli zinenani elivamile noma elincishisiwe lamaseli amhlophe egazi ayi-peripheral (ikakhulukazi ama-lymphocyte) ezigabeni zokuqala.	Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
257	en	zu	For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count &lt; 4×109/L including lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.	Ngokwesibonelo, i-lymphopenia enesibalo samaseli egazi amhlophe esithi < 4×109/L okuhlanganisa isibalo se-lymphocyte esithi < 1×109/L, kanye namazinga aphakeme e-aspartate aminotransferase kanye ne-viremia atholwa kuziguli ezingu-1,099 ezine-COVID-19.	For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L which includes a lymphocyte count that < 1×109/L, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
258	en	zu	The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.	Amazinga ama-enzyme esibindi nomsipha kanye ne-myoglobin ayephakeme egazini lezinye iziguli, futhi iphrotheni eyi-C-reactive kanye ne-erythrocyte sedimentation yayiphakeme egazini leziguli eziningi.	Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were higher in the blood of many patients.
259	en	zu	In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.	Kuziguli ezinokugula okubucayi, izinga le-D-dimer, umkhiqizo wokuwohloka kwe-fibrin okhona egazini, laliphakeme, futhi isibalo se-lymphocyte lalinciphe ngokuphawulekayo.	For patients with critical illness, the d-dimer level, the product of existing fibrin breakdown in the blood, was high, and the lymphocyte count had decreased dramatically.
260	en	zu	Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.	Kwatholwa okungajwayelekile ku-radiography yesifuba yeziguli eziningi ezine-COVID-19 futhi okunezici zethunzi elinamapheshi akabili noma i-ground glass opacity emaphasheni.	Abnormal findings were found in chest radiography of many patients with COVID-19 and with two-sided copper characteristics or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
261	en	zu	Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	Iziguli zivame ukuphathwa inyumoniya engavamile, ukulimala kwephaphu okubucayi, kanye ne-acute respiratory distress syndrome (I-ARDS).	Patients are more likely to be treated for rare pneumonia, critical lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
262	en	zu	When ARDS happens, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.	Lapho kwenzeka i-ARDS, ukuvuvukala okungalawuliwe, ukukhula koketshezi, kanye ne-fibrosis ethuthukayo kufaka engcupheni ukushintshana kwegesi.	When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid growth, and progressive fibrosis threaten gas exchange.
263	en	zu	Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.	Ukungasebenzi kahle kohlobo-I nohlobo-II lwe-pneumocyte kunciphisa izinga le-surfactant futhi kunyuse ukucindezeleka kwendawo engaphezulu, ngaleyo ndlela kuncishiswe ikhono lamaphaphu lokunwebeka futhi okunyusa ingozi yokuwa kwamaphaphu.	Type-I and type-II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface stress, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to stretch and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
264	en	zu	Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.	Ngakho-ke, imiphumela emibi kakhulu ye-radiography ivame ukufana nesimo esibucayi kakhulu sesifo.	Therefore, the worst effects of radiography tend to resemble the most critical condition of the disease.
265	en	zu	On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.	Ngo-February 18, 2020, ukuhlaziya kokuqala oku-pathological kwe-COVID-19 kwabonisa ukuxebuka kwama-pneumocyte, ukwakheka kolwelwesi lwe-hyaline, kanye nokufinyelelwa kwe-interstitial lymphocyte, kanye namaseli e-multinucleated syncytial emaphasheni esiguli esibulawe isifo, okuhambisana ne-pathology yesifo segciwane kanye ne-ARDS futhi okufana nalokho kweziguli ze-SARS ne-MERS.	February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte breakdown, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte access, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a terminally ill patient, associated with viral pathology and ARDS and similarities in SARS and MERS patients.
266	en	zu	The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.	Ukutholwa kwe-RNA ye-SARS-CoV-2 kusetshenziswa i-reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (I-RT-PCR) kwasetshenziswa njengombandela omkhulu wokuxilongwa kwe-COVID-19.	RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major diagnostic issue for COVID-19.
267	en	zu	However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.	Nokho, ngenxa yenani eliphakeme lenegethivu engeyikho, engase isheshise umqedazwe, ukubonakala kwezokwelashwa kwaqala ukusetshenziswa lapho kuxilongwa (okwakungathembele kuphela ku-RT-PCR) e-China ngo-February 13, 2020.	However, due to the high number of non-existent doses, which may speed up the diagnosis, medical visibility was first used during the diagnosis (which was not only dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
268	en	zu	A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.	Kwavela isimo esifanayo lapho kuxilongwa i-SARS.	A similar situation arose during the SARS diagnosis.
269	en	zu	Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.	Ngakho-ke, inhlanganisela yomlando wesifo, ukubonakaliswa kwezokwelashwa, ukuhlolwa kwaselabhorethri, nemiphumela ye-radiological ibalulekile futhi isemqoka ukuze kwenziwe ukuxilongwa okuyimpumelelo.	Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory testing, and radiological results is important and key to successful diagnosis.
270	en	zu	On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.	Ngo-February 14, 2020, iqembu le-Feng Zhang lachaza iphrothokholi yokusebenzisa indlela ka-SHERLOCK esekelwe ku-CRISPR ukuze kutholwe i-SARS-CoV-2, ethola izingxenyana ezingezona ezemvelo ze-RNA ye-SARS-CoV-2 ku-20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (amakhophi angu-10-100 nge-microliter ngayinye yokufakiwe) kusetshenziswa induku yokugcobhoza enkathini engaphansi kwehora ngaphandle kokudinga amathuluzi ayinkimbinkimbi.	On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team outlined a protocol to use the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, receiving non-natural RNA fractions of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of ingestion) using a drilling rod in less than an hour without requiring sophisticated tools.
271	en	zu	Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.	Sithemba ukuthi indlela entsha izothuthukisa kakhulu ukuzwela nezinzuzo uma kuqinisekisiwe kumasampula ezokwelashwa.	We hope the new approach will greatly improve sensitivity and benefits if confirmed in clinical samples.
272	en	zu	Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table ​(Table2).2).	Ngenxa yokuntula okuhlangenwe nakho nge-CoV entsha, odokotela ngokuyinhloko bangakwazi ukunikeza ukunakekelwa kokusekela kuziguli ze-COVID-19, kuyilapho bezama izinhlobonhlobo zezindlela zokwelapha ezisetshenzisiwe noma eziphakanyisiwe ngaphambilini ukuze kwelashwe amanye ama-CoV afana ne-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV nezinye izifo zamagciwane (Ithebula ​(Ithebula2).2).	Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors may primarily be able to provide support care to COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of previously used or proposed treatment options for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table (Table2).2).
273	en	zu	These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.	Lokhu kwelashwa kuhlanganisa ukwelashwa kwamanje nokungase kube ukwelashwa ngemithi elwa namagciwane, ama-immunosuppressant, ama-steroid, i-plasma evela kuziguli eziluleme, imithi yama-Chinese, kanye nosizo lwezengqondo.	This treatment includes current and potential treatments with antibiotics, immunosuppressant, steroids, plasma from patients with dementia, Chinese medicine, and psychological assistance.
274	en	zu	Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.	Kwenziwa ngisho nesiphakamiso sokusebenzisa i-plasma yeziguli eziluleme njengendlela yokwelashwa.	Even a suggestion was made to use plasma for patients with diabetes as a treatment option.
275	en	zu	Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.	Izinkampani zama-pharmaceutical ziyaqhudelana ukuze zakhe izivikeli-mzimba nemigomo emelene negciwane.	Pharmaceutical companies are fighting each other to build immune and anti-virus policies.
276	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.	I-SARS-CoV-2 ngokuyinhloko ihlasela amaphaphu ekuqaleni futhi cishe iphinde ihlasele, ngokwezinga elincane, ezinye izitho zomzimba ezibonisa i-ACE2, njengesistimu ye-gastrointestinal kanye nezinso.	SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and is likely to re-attack, to a lesser extent, other organs showing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
277	en	zu	Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death.	Noma kunjalo, ukungasebenzi kahle kanye nokuhluleka kwendlela yokuphefumula kuwusongo olukhulu kuziguli futhi kuyimbangela enkulu yokufa.	However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and are a major cause of death.
278	en	zu	Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.	Ngakho-ke, ukusekelwa kokuphefumula kubalulekile ukuze kudambiswe izimpawu futhi kusindiswe izimpilo futhi kuhlanganisa ukwelashwa okuvamile ngomoya-mpilo, ukugeleza okuphakeme komoya-mpilo, ukufakwa komoya ngaphandle kwemishini elimaza umzimba, kanye nokufakwa komoya kusetshenziswa imishini elimaza umzimba kuye ngobucayi besifo.	Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes conventional oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, ventilation without harmful equipment, and ventilation is used for harmful equipment that has been critical to the disease.
279	en	zu	Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.	Iziguli ezinezimpawu zokuphefumula ezibucayi kufanele zisekelwe kusetshenziswa i-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (I-ECMO), indlela elungisiwe yokuhlinzwa ye-cardiopulmonary esetshenziselwa ukwelapha ukwehluleka kokusebenza kwenhliziyo noma kokuphefumula okusongela ukuphila.

283	en	zu	These cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast number of free radicals which are the major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.	Lawa ma-cytokine akhuthaza amasosha omzimba ukuthi akhulule inani elikhulu nama-radical akhululekile ayimbangela eyinhloko ye-ARDS kanye nokuhluleka kwezitho zomzimba eziningi.	These cytokines stimulate the immune system to release large amounts and free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of many organs.
284	en	zu	Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.	Ukucindezelwa kwamasosha omzimba kubalulekile ekwelashweni kweziphepho ze-cytokine, ikakhulukazi kuziguli ezibucayi.	Immune stress is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critical patients.
285	en	zu	Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.	Ama-corticosteroid kanye ne-tocilizumab, isivikeli-mzimba esiyi-anti-IL6 monoclonal, kuye kwasetshenziswa ukuze kwelashwe isiphepho se-cytokine.	Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal immune system, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
286	en	zu	Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of T cell-directed immune response; the blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.	Okunye ukwelashwa kokucindezelwa kwamasosha omzimba kwesiphepho se-cytokine kuhlanganisa ukulawulwa kokusabela kwamasosha omzimba okuqondiswe kuseli lika-T; ukuvinjwa kwe-IFN-γ, IL-1, kanye ne-TNF; ukuthiywa kwe-JAK ; i-blinatumomab; umcindezeli wokusetshenziswa kwesiginali ye-cytokine 4; kanye nezivimbi ze-HDAC.	Other treatments for the immune suppression of cytokine storm include control of the immune response directed at the T cell; prevention of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK' name; blinatumomab; pressure for cytokine signaling use 4; and HDAC blockers.
287	en	zu	Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.	Ama-steroid, njengama-immunosuppressant, asetshenziswa kabanzi ukwelashweni kwe-SARS ukuze kuncishiswe ubucayi komonakalo wokuvuvukala.	Steroids, such as immunosuppressant, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
288	en	zu	However, steroids at high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.	Nokho, ama-steroid kusilinganiso esiphakeme awazange azuzise ekulimaleni kwamaphaphu okubucayi ezigulini eziphethwe i-SARS kanye ne-COVID-19.	However, steroids on high doses did not benefit from critical lung damage in patients suffering from SARS and COVID-19.
289	en	zu	Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.	Kunalokho, kungase kubangele imiphumela engathandeki ebucayi, ikakhulukazi i-avascular osteonecrosis, okuphazamisa ngendlela ephawulekayo i-prognosis.	Rather, it may cause serious adverse effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly disrupts the prognosis.
290	en	zu	Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients.	Noma kunjalo, uhlelo olufushane lwama-corticosteroid ngezilinganiso eziphansi kuye kwezimaphakathi ziye zatuswa ukuthi zisetshenziswe ngokucophelela kuziguli ze-COVID-19 ezigula ngendlela ebucayi.	However, the short corticosteroid system in low to medium doses has been credited with being used carefully in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
291	en	zu	At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.	Ngesikhathi sokubhala, akukho ukwelashwa okusebenzayo okulwa negciwane okwase kuqinisekisiwe.	At the time of writing, no effective anti-viral treatment has been confirmed.
292	en	zu	However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be efficacious in an American patient with COVID-19.	Nokho, ukufakwa emthanjeni nge-remdesivir, okuyi-nucleotide analog, kwatholwa kusebenza esigulini esiyi-American esine-COVID-19.	However, intravenous injection with remdesivir, which is an analog nucleotide, was found to work in an American patient with COVID-19.
293	en	zu	Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.	I-Remdesivir iwumuthi omusha olwa negciwane owaqala wakhiqizwa yi-Gilead ukuze kwelashwe izifo ezibangelwa amagciwane e-Ebola ne-Marlburg.	Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
294	en	zu	Later, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.	Kamuva, i-remdesivir yaphinde yabonisa ukuthi yayingase ivimbele amagciwane e-RNA anomucu owodwa okuhlanganisa amagciwane e-MERS ne-SARS.	Later, remdesivir also showed that it could block single-stranded RNA viruses that combine MERS and SARS viruses.
295	en	zu	Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.	Ngokusekelwe kulokhu, i-Gilead inikeze i-China isakhi ukuze iqhube izingcwaningo kubantu abaphethwe i-SARS-CoV-2, futhi imiphumela ibhekwe ngabomvu.	Based on this, Gilead has provided China with a component to conduct studies on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are looked at in red.
296	en	zu	In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, i-baricitinb, i-interferon-α, i-lopinavir/ritonavir, kanye ne-ribavirin kuye kwaphakanyiswa njengokungase kube ukwelashwa kweziguli ezinezimpawu zokuphefumula ezibucayi.	Additionally, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as a potential treatment for patients with critical respiratory symptoms.
297	en	zu	Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur following combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.	Isifo sohudo, isicanucanu, ukuhlanza, ukulimala kwesibindi, nokunye ukusabela okubucayi kungase kuvele ngemva kokwelashwa okuyinhlanganisela nge-lopinavir/ritonavir.	Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other critical reactions may arise after a combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
298	en	zu	The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in the patients should be monitored carefully.	Ukusebenzelana kwalokhu kwelashwa neminye imithi esetshenziswe kuziguli kufanele kuqashelwe ngokucophelela.	The interaction of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
299	en	zu	Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation	I-Plasma evela kuziguli eziluleme nokwakhiwa kwezivikeli-mzimba	Plasma from patients with allergies and immune structure
300	en	zu	The collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.	Ukuqoqwa kwegazi leziguli eziluleme esifweni esithathelanayo ukuze kwelashwe ezinye iziguli eziphethwe isifo esifanayo noma ukuze kuvikelwe abantu abaphile kahle ukuthi bangasitholi isifo kunomlando omude.	The collection of blood for patients with epilepsy to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection has a long history.
301	en	zu	Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.	Eqinisweni, iziguli eziluleme zivame ukuba nezinga eliphakeme lezivikeli-mzimba ezimelana nesifo esisegazini labo.	In fact, patients with dementia tend to have a higher level of immune resistance to disease in their blood.
302	en	zu	Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.	Izivikeli-mzimba ziyi-immunoglobulin (Ig) ekhiqizwa ama-B lymphocyte ukuze kuliwe nezifo kanye nezinye izinto ezingadingekile emzimbeni futhi zikwazi ukubona amangqamuzana ahlukile ezifweni futhi awenze angasebenzi ngokuqondile.	The immune system is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight diseases and other unnecessary substances in the body and can detect different cells in diseases and make them directly inactive.
303	en	zu	Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients.	Ngokusekelwe kulokhu, i-plasma yaqoqwa egazini leqembu leziguli ezilulame ku-COVID-19 futhi yajovwa kuziguli ezigula ezingu-10 ngendlela ebucayi ezingu-.	Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
304	en	zu	Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.	Izimpawu zazo zaba ngcono emahoreni angu-24, okwahambisana nokuvuvukala okuncishisiwe kanye nemithamo yegciwane kanye nokugcwala komoya-mpilo okuthuthukile egazini.	Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral doses and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
305	en	zu	However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed.	Nokho, ukuqinisekiswa kanye nokucaciswa kuyadingeka ukuze kwenziwe isiphakamiso sokuthi indlela isetshenziswe kabanzi ngaphambi kokuthi ukwelashwa okuthile kuthuthukiswe.	However, validation and clarification are needed to make a suggestion that the method is widely used before certain treatments are developed.
306	en	zu	In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, uma kucatshangelwa imiphumela yokwelashwa, okunye okungazuzisi okuhlobene ne-plasma kufanele kucatshangelwe ngokucophelela.	Additionally, when considering the effects of treatment, other non-plasma-related side effects should be carefully considered.
307	en	zu	For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxicity.	Ngokwesibonelo, izivikeli-mzimba zingakhuthaza ngokwedlulele ukusabela kwamasosha omzimba futhi kubangele isifo sokukhululwa kwe-cytokine, okungase kube ubungozi obusongela ukuphila.	For example, the immune system can excessively promote the immune response and cause cytokine release disease, which can be life-threatening.
308	en	zu	The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients.	Umthamo wezivikeli-mzimba ezisegazini ngokuvamile uphansi, futhi isidingo se-plasma sikhulu ukuthi kungalashwa iziguli ezigula ngendlela ebucayi.	The immune system in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
309	en	zu	It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global epidemic.	Kunzima ukwakha nokukhiqiza izivikeli-mzimba ezithile ngokushesha okukhulu ukuze kuliwe nomqedazwe wembulunga yonke.	It is difficult to build and produce certain immune responses very quickly to combat globalization.
310	en	zu	Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.	Ngenxa yalokho, kubaluleke kakhulu futhi kunengqondo ukuhlukanisa amaseli ka-B eziguli eziluleme futhi kuphawulwe amakhodi ezakhi zofuzo anezakhi zofuzo ezisebenzayo noma kuhlungwe izivikeli-mzimba ezisebenzayo ekumeleleni amaphrotheni abalulekile egciwane.	As a result, it is very important and reasonable to isolate B cells in patients with dementia and to mark genetic codes with active genes or to filter out immune systems that are effective in representing important viral proteins.
311	en	zu	This way, we can readily scale up the production of the antibodies.	Ngale ndlela, singakwazi ukunyusa ukukhiqizwa kwezivikeli-mzimba.	In this way, we can increase the production of immune system.
312	en	zu	TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.	I-TCM iye yasetshenziswa ukuze kulashwe izinhlobonhlobo zezifo e-China izinkulungwane zeminyaka.	TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
313	en	zu	However, its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.	Nokho, imithelela yayo incike kakhulu ekuhlanganisweni kwezingxenye eziningi kufomula ehlukahlukayo kuye ngokuxilongwa kwesifo ngokusekelwe embonweni ye-TCM.	However, its effects depend heavily on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM vision.
314	en	zu	Most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.	Iningi lezingxenye ezisebenzayo zihlala zingaziwa noma azicacile njengoba kunzima ukumonyula nokuqinisekisa izingxenye ezinjalo noma izinhlanganisela zayo ezisebenza kangcono.	Most of the active components remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to pick and verify such components or combinations that work best.
315	en	zu	Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.	Okwamanje, ngenxa yokuntuleka yokwelashwa okusebenzayo nokuqondile kwe-COVID-19, i-TCM isiphenduke okunye kokwelashwa okukhulu kweziguli ezinezimpawu ezincane kuye kwezimaphakathi kulabo abalulame ezigabeni ezibucayi.	Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has turned into one of the largest treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms in those who are moderate in critical stages.
316	en	zu	For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.	Ngokwesibonelo, amaphilisi e-Shu Feng Jie Du kanye namaphilisi e-Lian Hua Qing Wen kwatholwa ukuthi ayasebenza ekwelashweni kwe-COVID-19.	For example, Shu Feng Jie Du tablets and Lian Hua Qing Wen tablets were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
317	en	zu	Top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas Hubei province, which used TCM in only approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).	Izilinganiso eziphakeme zokwelashwa ekwelashweni kweziguli ezine-COVID-19 zaphawulwa ezifundazweni eziningi zase-China ezisebenzise i-TCM ku-87% weziguli zabo, okuhlanganisa i-Gansu (63.7%), i-Ningxia (50%), ne-Hunan (50%), kuyilapho isifundazwe sase-Hubei, esasebenzisa i-TCM cishe ku-30% weziguli zaso ezine-COVID-19, saba nesilinganiso esiphansi kakhulu sokululama (13%).	Higher rates of treatment in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were noted in many Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which still uses TCM for about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
318	en	zu	However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.	Nokho, lokhu kuwukuqhathanisa okunganembile njengoba ezinye izici zomthelela ezifana nenani nobucayi beziguli kufanele zifakwe ekuhlaziyweni.	However, this is an inaccurate comparison as some aspects of the impact such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the analysis.
319	en	zu	On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM.	Ngo-February 18, 2020, u-Boli Zhang nozakwabo bashicilela ucwaningo lokuqhathanisa ukwelashwa ngemithi yasentshonalanga (WM) yodwa kanye nokwelashwa okuyinhlanganisela kwe-WM ne-TCM.	On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing western medicine treatment (WM) alone with a combination treatment of WM and TCM.
320	en	zu	They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization were remarkably shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group.	Bathola ukuthi izikhathi ezidingekayo ukuze izinga lokushisa komzimba lilulame, kuphele izimpawu, kanye nokulaliswa esibhedlela kwakukufushane eqenjini le-WM+TCM kuneqembu le-WM kuphela.	They found that the times needed for body temperature to ease, end symptoms, and hospitalization were shorter in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
321	en	zu	Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).	Okuhlaba umxhwele kakhulu, ukuthi izinga lokuba libi kwezimpawu (ukusuka kwezincane kuye kwezibucayi) laliphansi ngokuphawulekayo eqenjini le-WM+TCM kuneqembu le-WM kuphela (u-7.4% oqhathaniswa no-46.2%) futhi ukufa kwakuphansi kakhudlwana eqenjini le-WM+TCM kuneqembu le-WM kuphela (u-8.8% oqhathaniswa no-39%).	Most impressively, that the severity rate of symptoms (from minor to critical) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and deaths were significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
322	en	zu	Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.	Noma kunjalo, ukusebenza nokuphepha kwe-TCM kusalinde izingcwaningo ezilawulwe kahle emazingeni amakhulu nasezikhungweni eziningi.	However, the performance and safety of TCM is still waiting for well-managed studies at large and multi-institutional levels.
323	en	zu	It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.	Kungaphinde futhi kuhlabe umxhwele ukuthi kuphawulwe indlela yezenzo futhi kucaciswe ukuthi izingxenye ezisebenzayo zokwelashwa kwe-TCM noma izinhlanganisela zayo uma kunokwenzeka.	It may also impress that it has marked the course of action and explained that the active components of TCM treatment or its combinations if possible.
324	en	zu	Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.	Iziguli okunezinsolo noma eziqinisekisiwe ukuthi ziphethwe i-COVID-19 ngokuvamile ziyasisaba kakhulu isifo esithelelena kakhulu futhi esibulalayo, futhi abantu abazivalele baphinde babhoreke, babe nesizungu, kanye nolaka.	Patients with underlying or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally more likely to develop a highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who self-isolate also become dizzy, dizzy, and aggressive.
325	en	zu	Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, izimpawu zokutheleleka ezifana nemfiva, i-hypoxia, nokukhwehlela kanye nemiphumela ebucayi yokwelashwa efana nokuqwasha ebangelwa ama-corticosteroid ingaholela ekubeni nexhala okwengeziwe nokucindezeleka ngokomqondo.	Additionally, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and critical treatment effects such as alertness caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and depression.
326	en	zu	In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.	Esigabeni sokuqala sokubheduka kwe-SARS, izifo eziningi ezihlobene nengqondo okuhlanganisa ukucindezeleka okuphikelelayo, ixhala, ukushaywa uvalo, ukuphazamiseka kwekhono lengqondo lokunyakazisa umzimba, izimpawu zokusangana, ukuhanjelwa ingqondo, ngisho nokufuna ukuzibulala kwabikwa.

333	en	zu	However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.	Nokho, ukusebenza ezintweni eziphilayo kwalawa makhandidethi omgomo kubantu abadala kanye namamodeli enselele ebulalayo kanye nokuvikeleka kwawo ekungenweni igciwane elisuka ezilwaneni liye kubantu kusazotholwa ngaphambi kokuthi kuqaliswe ucwaningo lwezokwelashwa.	However, the biological efficacy of these policy campaigns in adults and the models of the deadly challenge and their protection against the transmission of the animal-to-human virus will still be achieved before a medical study is launched.
334	en	zu	This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.	Lokhu kungenxa yokuthi i-SARS yathula eminyakeni engu-17 edlule futhi akukho ukugula kwayo okusha okuye kwabikwa kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.	This is because SARS was silent 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
335	en	zu	In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, izimo eziyimvela kancane kanye namaqoqo e-MERS ayaqhubeka evela e-Middle East futhi asakazeka nakwezinye izifunda ngenxa yokuphikelela kwemithombo yamagciwane asuka ezilwaneni aye kubantu ezindaweni ezinesifo.	On the other hand, rare cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge from the Middle East and spread to other regions due to persistent sources of viruses from animals to humans in infected areas.
336	en	zu	Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.	Amasu okugoma aye enzelwa i-MERS ngokuthi kusetshenziswe igciwane elingasebenzi, ama-plasmid e-DNA, ama-vector egciwane, ama-nanoparticle, izinhlayiya ezifana negciwane kanye namayunithi angaphansi ephrotheni eyinhlanganisela futhi amanye aye ahlolwa kumamodeli ezilwane.	Vaccine techniques have been developed for MERS by using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and sub-units of a composite protein and some have been tested in animal models.
337	en	zu	The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.	Ukwakhiwa komgomo ophephile nosebenzayo omelene ne-SARS-CoV-2 kubantu abathelelekayo kuwumsebenzi ophuthumayo nobalulekile ekulawuleni umqedazwe oqhubekayo.	The construction of a safe and effective policy against SARS-CoV-2 in infected people is an urgent and important task in managing the ongoing eradicator.
338	en	zu	However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (averaged 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.	Nokho, kuyinselele ukumelana nobunzima ngenxa yenkathi ende (isilinganiso sezinyanga ezingu-18) edingekayo ukuze kwakhiwe umgomo kanye nezinhlobo ezishintshayo zama-CoV.	However, it is challenging to cope with difficulties due to the long term (average of 18 months) required to build a policy and variable types of CoV.
339	en	zu	As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.	Njengesifo esisha, i-COVID-19 isanda kuqala ukubonisa uhlelo lwayo lwezokwelashwa olugcwele ezigulini eziyizinkulungwane.	As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to showcase its full medical program to thousands of patients.
340	en	zu	In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.	Ezimweni eziningi, iziguli zingakwazi ukululama kancane ngaphandle kwemiphumela yesifo sangaphambilini.	In most cases, patients may be less able to recover without the side effects of the previous disease.
341	en	zu	However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.	Nokho, ngokufana ne-SARS ne-MERS, i-COVID-19 iphinde ihlotshaniswe nezinga eliphakeme lokugula nokufa ezigulini ezinokugula okubucayi.	However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher rate of illness and death in patients with critical illness.
342	en	zu	Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.	Ngakho-ke, ukwakha imodeli yembangela yesifo kubalulekile kuma-ejensi okunakekelwa kwezempilo ukuze kubekwe ekuqaleni amasevisi awo, ikakhulukazi ezindaweni ezinezinsiza ezincane.	Therefore, building a disease cause model is important for healthcare agencies to prioritise their services, especially in low-resource areas.
343	en	zu	Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table ​(Table33):	Ngokusekelwe kuzingcwaningo zokwelashwa ezibikwe kuze kube manje, izici ezilandelayo zingase zithinte noma zihlotshaniswe nembangela yeziguli ze-COVID-19 (Ithebula ​(Ithebula33):	Based on the treatment studies reported so far, the following factors may be affected or linked to the cause of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
344	en	zu	Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.	Ubudala: Ubudala babuyisici esibaluleke kakhulu sembangela ye-SARS, okuyiqiniso futhi nge-COVID-19.	Age: Age was a very important factor in the cause of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
345	en	zu	COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.	I-COVID-19 yavela ngokuyinhloko kubudala obungu-30-65 futhi u-47.7% walezo ziguli zazingaphezu kuka-50 kucwaningo lweziguli ezingu-8,866 njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla.	COVID-19 emerged primarily at an age of 30-65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a study of 8,866 patients as described above.
346	en	zu	Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.	Iziguli ezazidinga ukunakekelwa kwezimo ezibucayi zazinethuba eliphakeme lokuphathwa ezinye izifo nezinkimbinkimbi futhi zazindala ngokuphawulekayo kunalezo ezingenazo (ubudala ongu-66 buqhathaniswa no-51), okusikisela ukuthi ubudala buyisici esiyimbangela kumphumela kuziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19.	Patients who needed critical care had a higher chance of being treated for other diseases and complications and grew significantly older than those without (age 66 compared to 51), suggesting age is a factor in the outcome for patients suffering from COVID-19.
347	en	zu	Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.	Ubulili: I-SARS-CoV-2 igulise abantu besilisa abaningi kunabantu besifazane (u-0.31/100,000 oqhathaniswa no-0.27/100,000), njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla.	Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has sickened more males than females (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
348	en	zu	Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.	Izifo ezikhona kakade nezinkimbinkimbi: Iziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19 ezidinga ukunakekelwa okubucayi zinethuba eliphakeme lokuphathwa ukulimala kwenhliziyo okubucayi kanye ne-arrhythmia.	Already present and complex diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who need critical care have a higher chance of being treated for critical heart injuries and arrhythmia.
349	en	zu	Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients.	Izehlakalo ezihlobene nenhliziyo zaphinde zaba isizathu esiyinhloko sokufa kweziguli ezine-SARS.	Cardiovascular-related events also became the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
350	en	zu	It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.	Kuphindwe kwabikwa ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 iyakwazi futhi ukunamathela kuma-ACE2-positive cholangiocyte, okungase kuholele ekungasebenzini kahle kwesibindi kuziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19.	It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also able to adhere to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients suffering from COVID-19.
351	en	zu	It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.	Kuhle ukuphawula ukuthi ubudala kanye nesifo esikhona kakade kuhlobene nokuqinile futhi kungase kuphazamisane.	It is good to note that age and pre-existing disease are strongly related and may be disruptive.
352	en	zu	Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.	Imiphumela yaselabhorethri engavamile: Izinga lephrotheni ye-C-reactive (CRP) egazini ibonisa ubucayi bokuvuvukala noma ukulimala kwesicubu futhi kuye kwaphakanyiswa ukuthi kuyisici esingase sibe imbangela yesifo, ukusabela ekwelashweni, kanye nokululama okuphelele.	Abnormal laboratory results: The level of the C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested to be a potential cause of the disease, reaction to treatment, and complete relief.
353	en	zu	The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.	Kuphinde kwenziwa ukuhlobana kwezinga le-CRP nobucayi nembangela ye-COVID-19.	There has also been a correlation of CRP level and severity with the cause of COVID-19.
354	en	zu	In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, i-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ephakeme, i-aspartate aminotransferase (AST), i-alanine aminotransferase (ALT), kanye ne-creatine kinase (CK) ingase futhi isize ukubikezela umphumela.	Additionally, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the effect.
355	en	zu	These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.	Lawa ma-enzyme aboniswa kabanzi ezithweni eziningi, ikakhulukazi enhliziyweni nakusibindi, futhi kukhululwa phakathi nokulimala kwesicubu.	These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
356	en	zu	Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.	Ngenxa yalokho, ziyizinkomba ezivamile zokungasebenzi kahle kwenhliziyo noma isibindi.	As a result, they are common indicators of heart or liver dysfunction.
357	en	zu	Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.	Izimpawu zokwelashwa ezinkulu: I-radiography yesifuba nokuqhubeka kwesikhashana kwezimpawu zokwelashwa kufanele zicatshangelwe ndawonye nezinye izinkinga zokubikezelwa kwemiphumela nezinkimbinkimbi ze-COVID-19.	Major treatment symptoms: Chest radiography and temporary progression of treatment symptoms should be considered along with other complications of predicting the effects and complications of COVID-19.
358	en	zu	Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.	Ukusetshenziswa kwama-steroid: Njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla, ama-steroid angama-immunosuppressant ngokuvamile asetshenziswa njengokwelashwa kokwenezela kwezifo ezithelelanayo ukuze kuncishiswe ubucayi komonakalo wokuvuvukala.	Steroid use: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as an extension treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
359	en	zu	Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality.	Njengoba kusetshenziswe kabanzi inani eliphakeme lama-corticosteroid kuziguli ezine-SARS ebucayi, iningi labantu abasinda babephethwe i-avascular osteonecrosis benokukhubazeka kokuphila kwabo konke nezinga lokuphila elingelihle.	Since a high number of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with critical SARS, most of the survivors were suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with a lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
360	en	zu	Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.	Ngenxa yalokho, uma edingekile, ama-steroid kufanele asetshenziswe ngesilinganiso esiphansi futhi isikhathi esifushane kuziguli ze-COVID-19.	As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low and short-term dose for COVID-19 patients.
361	en	zu	Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.	Ukucindezeleka komqondo: Njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla, phakathi nokubheduka kwe-COVID-19 iziguli eziningi zaphathwa ukucindezeleka okukhulu njengoba kwakufanele zibekezelele izinkathi ezide zokuzivalela nokungaqiniseki okukhulu futhi zibona ukufa kwamalungu omndeni aseduze kanye neziguli ezikanye nazo.	Depression: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients were subjected to severe depression as they had to endure long periods of self-isolation and severe uncertainty and see the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
362	en	zu	It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.	Kusemqoka ukuthi kunikezwe ukwelulekwa komqondo nokusekelwa kwesikhathi eside ukuze kusizwe lezi ziguli zilulame ekucindezelekeni futhi zibuyele empilweni evamile.	It is important to provide long-term psychological counseling and support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
363	en	zu	According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.	Ngokuvumelana nezingcwaningo zolwazi lwabantu kuze kube manje, i-COVID-19 ibonakala inezici ze-epidemiological ezihlukile ku-SARS.	According to human information studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics that differ from SARS.
364	en	zu	In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.	Ngaphezu kokuphindeka kumgudu wokuphefumula ongezansi, i-SARS-CoV-2 iyakwazi ukuphindeka kalula kumgudu wokuphefumula ongenhla futhi ibangele izimpawu ezincane noma ingazibangeli esigabeni sokuqala sokutheleleka, ngendlela efanayo nama-CoV abangela imikhuhlane evamile.	In addition to replication in the lower respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 is able to easily replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, in the same way as CoVs that cause normal flu.
365	en	zu	Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.	Ngakho-ke, iziguli ezithelelekile esigabeni sokuqala noma enkathini yokufukanyelwa zingakhiqiza inani elikhulu legciwane phakathi nemisebenzi yansuku zonke, okubangela ubunzima obukhulu bokulawulwa komqedazwe.	Therefore, patients involved in the initial stage or in the induced period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, resulting in greater difficulty in the control of the virus.
366	en	zu	However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.	Nokho, ukutheleleka kwe-SARS-CoV kwakucatshangwa ukuthi kwenzeka lapho iziguli zazigula kakhulu, kuyilapho ukutheleleka okuningi kungazange kwenzeke esigabeni sokuqala.	However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
367	en	zu	Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.	Ngenxa yalokho, ukubheduka kwe-COVID-19 kubucayi kakhulu futhi kunzima ukukulawula kunokubheduka kwe-SARS.	As a result, the COVID-19 mutation is more sensitive and difficult to control than the SARS mutation.
368	en	zu	Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	Kunemizamo eminingi eqhubekayo njengamanje e-China okuhlanganisa ukuvalwa thaqa kwe-Wuhan namadolobha azungezile nokuzivalela okuqhubekayo kwaso sonke isibalo sabantu ngethemba lokuphazamisa ukudluliswa kwe-SARS-CoV-2.	There are many ongoing efforts currently underway in China that include the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued self-isolation of the entire population in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
369	en	zu	Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.	Nakuba lezi zinyathelo ziwulimaze kakhulu umnotho neminye imikhakha yezwe, inani leziguli ezintsha liyancipha, okubonisa ukuncipha kwejubane lomqedazwe.	Although these measures have severely hurt the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a decrease in the pace of completion.
370	en	zu	The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.	Isilinganiso esithembisa kakhulu esokuthi ukubheduka kuzophela ngo-March futhi isigaba sokuncipha sizoqhubeka izinyanga ezingu-3-4.	The most promising estimate is that the reversal will end in March and the contraction phase will continue for 3-4 months.
371	en	zu	However, some other experts are not that optimistic.	Nokho, ezinye izazi azinalo lelo themba.	However, some scholars do not have that hope.
372	en	zu	Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.	U-Paul Hunter, et al., ulinganisa ukuthi i-COVID-19, ebonakala ithelelana kakhulu kune-SARS, ngeke iphele ngo-2020.	Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
373	en	zu	Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.	U-Ira Longini, et al., wasungula imodeli yokubikezela umphumela womqedazwe futhi wasikisela ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 ingase iphathe izingxenye ezimbili kwezintathu zesibalo sabantu emhlabeni wonke.	Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of a vaccine and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may carry two-thirds of the global population.
374	en	zu	A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which indicates that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.	Iqembu lase-Canada labika ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 yatholwa kuwo womabili amaswabhu e-mid-turbinate kanye nawomphimbo eziguli ezalulama futhi zaphuma esibhedlela emavikini amabili ngaphambilini, okubonisa ukuthi igciwane elisanda kutholwa kungenzeka ukuthi libe isiqephu esiphindayo esifana nemfuluwenza.	The Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate labs and the vocal cords of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting the newly discovered virus is likely to be a recurring episode similar to influenza.
375	en	zu	However, promising signs have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating the current strategies might have been working.	Nokho, izimpawu ezithembisayo zivele e-China ngokusekelwe enanini elehlayo labantu abasha abagulayo, okubonisa ukuthi amasu amanje kungenzeka ukuthi ayasebenza.	However, promising signs have emerged in China based on a declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies are likely to work.
376	en	zu	Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.	Ekuqaleni kwakubikezelwe ukuthi i-Ebola yayizophatha abantu abayisigidi futhi kufe ingxenye yesigidi sabantu.	It was originally predicted that Ebola would affect a million people and die half a million people.
377	en	zu	However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been put under control.	Nokho, ngenxa yokuzivalela nokuzihlukanisa okuqinile, isifo sigcine silawuliwe.	However, due to strict self-isolation and isolation, the disease remains controlled.
378	en	zu	It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.	Kungenzeka, njenge-SARS-CoV, ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 ingase ibe buthaka ingabi namandla futhi ekugcineni iphele noma ibe igciwane elingagulisi kakhulu elikwazi ukuphilisana nabantu.	It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus capable of healing people.
379	en	zu	A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. ​(Fig.55).	Ukuqhathaniswa komqedazwe we-COVID-19 nalowo we-SARS kanye ne-MERS kunikezwa ngezansi (Umfa. ​(Umfa.55).	A comparison of the COVID-19 eradication with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Death. (Umfa.55).
380	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.	I-SARS-CoV-2 ithelelana kakhulu ngokukhwehlela noma ukuthimula, futhi kungenzeka ukuthi ngokuthintana okuqondile nezinto ezinegciwane.	SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing, and may be directly related to infected substances.
381	en	zu	The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.	Igciwane laphinde futhi latholwa endleni, okuveza ithuba elisha lokudluliselwa okusuka endleni kuye emlonyeni.	The virus was also found in the diet, presenting a new possibility of transmission from food to mouth.
382	en	zu	A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers.	Ucwaningo lwakamuva lweziguli ezingu-138 lwabika ukuthi u-41% weziguli kungenzeka ukuthi zatheleleka ezibhedlela, okuhlanganisa iziguli ezingu-17 ezazivele ziphethwe ezinye izifo ngaphambilini kanye nabanakekeli bezempilo abangu-40.	A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of patients were likely admitted to hospitals, which included 17 patients who had previously been infected with other diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
383	en	zu	Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.	Ngenxa yalokho, kufanele kusetshenziswe ukuqapha okukhulu ukuze kuvikelwe abantu, ikakhulukazi abahlinzeki bokunakekelwa kwezempilo, osonhlalakahle, amalungu omndeni, ozakwabo, ngisho nabantu abame eduze kweziguli noma abantu abathelelekile.	As a result, greater surveillance should be used to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, relatives, and even people standing near patients or people involved.
384	en	zu	The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.	Umugqa wokuqala wokuvikeleka ongase usetshenziswe ukuze kwehliswe ubungozi bokutheleleka uwukugqoka amamaski obuso; kokubili ukusetshenziswa kwemaski yokuhlinzwa kanye namamaski e-N95 respirator (uchungechunge # 1860s) kusiza ukulawula ukubhebhetheka kwamagciwane.	The first line of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) help control viral infections.
385	en	zu	Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.	Amamaski obuso okuhlinza avimba amaconsana awuketshezi avela kumuntu okungenzeka ukuthi uthelelekile ukuthi angahambi ngomoya futhi anamathele ebusweni bezinto, lapho engadluliselwa khona kwabanye abantu.	Surgical face masks block liquid droplets from a person who may have been suspected of not moving through the air and sticking to the surface of objects, where they can be transmitted to other people.
386	en	zu	However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are approximately 85 nm.	Nokho, amamaski e-N95 (uchungechunge # 1860s) kuphela angakwazi ukukuvikela ekuhogeleni ama-virion amancane ngo-10 kuye ku-80 nm, kuyilapho u-5% kuphela wama-virion okwazi ukudlula ngokuphelele; i-SARS-CoV-2 inosayizi ofanayo nowe-SARS-CoV kokubili kucishe kube ngu-85 nm.	However, only N95 masks (series #1860s) can protect you from smaller virions at 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of virion can completely pass; SARS-CoV-2 has the same size as SARS-CoV at both approximately 85 nm.
387	en	zu	Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.	Njengoba izinhlayiya zikwazi ukudlula kumamaski okuhlinza amahlanu ahlanganisiwe, abahlinzeki bezempilo abasebenza ngokuqondile neziguli kumelwe bagqoke amamaski e-N95 (uchungechunge # 1860s) hhayi amamaski okuhlinza.	Since particles can pass through five combined surgical masks, healthcare providers that work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (series #1860s) and not surgical masks.
388	en	zu	In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.	Ngaphezu kwamamaski, abahlinzeki bokunakekelwa kwezempilo kufanele bagqoke amagawuni okuzivikela abalingana kahle ukuze kuncishiswe ngokwengeziwe ukuthintana namagciwane.	In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear well-fitted protective gloves to further reduce contact with viruses.

It has been reported that there are asymptomatic people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may have an impact on its rapid global spread.
521	en	zu	Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.	Ukuqhathanisa nokuhlukanisa i-SARS-CoV-2 namanye ama-HCoV ayisithupha kuveza ukufana nokuhluka okuthakazelisa kakhulu.	Comparing and isolating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals similarities to the most interesting variations.
522	en	zu	First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.	Okokuqala, inkathi yokufukanyelwa kanye nobude besikhathi sokuqhubeka kwesifo se-HCoV kufana kakhulu.	First, the duration of transmission and the duration of the progression of HCoV is very similar.
523	en	zu	In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.	Ngokuqondene nalokhu, i-SARS-CoV-2 ilandela ithrendi evamile yamanye ama-HCoV ayisithupha.	In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows a normal thread of six other HCoVs.
524	en	zu	Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).	Okwesibili, ubucayi bezimpawu ze-COVID-19 buphakathi kwe-SARS-CoV kanye nama-HCoV amane atholwa emphakathini (okungukuthi i-HCoV-229E, i-HCoV-OC43, i-HCoV-HKU1 kanye ne-HCoV-NL63).	Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoV(i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
525	en	zu	On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, isifo se-SARS-CoV-2 sibonisa izici ezivame ukubonwa phakathi nokutheleleka ngama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini, okubandakanya ukungabikhona kwezimpawu ezicacile, izimpawu ezincane noma ukungabikhona kwezimpawu.	On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 disease shows characteristics commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, which include a lack of obvious symptoms, mild symptoms or a lack of symptoms.
526	en	zu	On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, isethi engaphansi encane yezimo ezibucayi ze-COVID-19 ingabonwa futhi njengasesimweni sesifo se-SARS-CoV, nakuba isilinganiso siphansi kancane.	On the other hand, a smaller sub-set of critical COVID-19 conditions can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV disease, although the rate is slightly lower.
527	en	zu	Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.	Okwesithathu, ukuthelelana kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuphinde kubonise amaphethini athakazelisayo anesici sawo womabili ama-HCoV atholakala emphakathini kanye ne-SARS-CoV.	Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also showed interesting patterns with a characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
528	en	zu	On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, ukudluliswa kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuphakeme njengokwama-HCoV atholwe emphakathini.	On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
529	en	zu	On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, kusazoqinisekiswa ukuthi ukudluliselwa kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuyancipha yini kubantu njengasesimweni se-SARS-CoV ne-MERS-CoV.	On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
530	en	zu	Finally, same as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.	Okokugcina, ngokufana namanye ama-HCoV, i-SARS-CoV-2 ingatholwa kumasampula endle.	Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in samples in the field.
531	en	zu	Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.	Ukuthi ukudluliswa ngendle-ngomlomo kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kudlala indima ebalulekile yini uma kuziwa ku-SARS-CoV ngaphansi kwezimo ezithile kusazocaciswa izingcwaningo zesikhathi esizayo.	Whether oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CoV under certain conditions will still be clarified by future studies.
532	en	zu	It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.	Kuphinde kuthakazelise kakhulu ukubona ukuthi ingabe i-SARS-CoV-2 izobonisa ukuvela ngezinkathi ezithile zonyaka njengoba kunjalo ngama-HCoV atholakala emphakathini.	It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show emergence at certain times of the year as it is with community-acquired HCoVs.
533	en	zu	Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.	Noma kunjalo, izici ze-SARS-CoV-2 okubandakanya ukutheleleka kwayo, i-pathogenicity nokubhebhetheka okulondolozekayo ngemva kokudlulela kubantu kuzoba nethonya esiphethweni sokugcina sokubheduka okuqhubekayo kwe-COVID-19.	However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its susceptibloability, pathogenicity and construed later exposure to humans will have a final impact on the end of the ongoing COVID-19 mutation.
534	en	zu	All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.	Wonke ama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini abangela izimpawu ezincane azivumelanise kahle nabantu.	All community-acquired HCoVs cause mild symptoms to adapt well to humans.
535	en	zu	From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.	Ngokomunye umbono, kungase futhi kube yiqiniso ukuthi abantu bazivumelanise kahle nalawa ma-HCoV amane.	From another perspective, it may also be true that people are well aligned with these four HCoVs.
536	en	zu	In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.	Ngamanye amazwi, kokubili kungenzeka ukuthi kwasinda kubhubhane lwe-HCoV yasendulo.	In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
537	en	zu	HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.	Ama-HCoV abangela izifo ezibucayi kubantu futhi abantu abaphathwa izifo ze-HCoV ebucayi abasekho.	HCoVs cause critical diseases in humans and people treated with critical HCoV infections are no longer there.
538	en	zu	For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.	Ukuze kwenzeke lokhu, ama-HCoV kufanele aphindeke kubantu ngokwezinga elanele ukuze kuvunyelwe ukukhula koshintsho oluvumelana nezimo okuphikisana nezici zokukhawulwa kombungazi.	For this to happen, HCoVs must be repeated to humans at an adequate rate to allow for the growth of flexible changes that contradict the characteristics of the host's limitations.
539	en	zu	In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.	Ngale ndlela, uma ukubheduka kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuphikelela futhi ithelela abantu abaningi, kuzoba nethuba elikhulu lokuthi izozivumelanisa kakhulu nabantu.	In this way, if the SARS-CoV-2 mutation persists and affects many people, there will be a greater chance that it will adapt more to humans.
540	en	zu	If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.	Uma izivumelanisa kahle kakhulu, ukuthelela kwayo abantu kungabanzima ukukuvimba ngokuzivalela noma ezinye izindlela zokulawula ukutheleleka.	If it adapts very well, its human involvement can be difficult to prevent by self-isolation or other ways of controlling infection.
541	en	zu	For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.	Sekuyiminyaka eminingi, ama-CoV amane atholwa emphakathini ejikeleza emphakathini wabantu, okubangela umkhuhlane ovamile kubantu abanokusabela okufanele kwamasosha omzimba.	For many years, four CoVs have been detected in the community circulating in the human community, causing a common flu in people with a proper immune response.
542	en	zu	These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.	Lawa magciwane awadingi umthombo oyisilwane.	These viruses do not need an animal source.
543	en	zu	In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.	Ngokuphambene nalokho, i-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV e-pathogenic kakhulu awakazivumelanisi kahle nabantu futhi ukuthelelana kwawo ngaphakathi kwabantu akukwazi ukulondolozwa.	Conversely, SARS-CoV and the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV do not interact well with humans and their interactions within humans cannot be maintained.
544	en	zu	They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.	Adinga ukuzigcina asesimweni futhi akhule kumthombo wawo we-zoonotic futhi afuna ithuba lokudlulela kuzisulu ezingachayeka, cishe ngombungazi omaphakathi oyedwa noma ngaphezulu futhi kukhuliswe ababungazi.	They need to keep themselves in shape and grow in their zoonotic source and want the opportunity to pass on to vulnerable victims, about one or more intermediates and raise strangers.
545	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.	I-SARS-CoV-2 inezici ezifana nakho kokubili i-SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV kanye nama-HCoV amane atholwa emphakathini.	SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
546	en	zu	It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.	Itheleleka kakhulu njengama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini, okungenani kusidalwa sokuqala.	It is highly contagious as community-acquired HCoVs, at least in the original creature.
547	en	zu	However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.	Nokho, i-pathogenic kakhulu kunama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini futhi ine-pathogenic encane ku-SARS-CoV noma i-MERS-CoV.	However, it is more pathogenic than Community-acquired HCoV and has less pathogenic pathogenic effects on SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
548	en	zu	It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.	Kusazobonwa ukuthi izozivumelanisa ngokugcwele yini nabantu futhi ijikeleze ngaphandle komthombo noma umbungazi wesilwane omaphakathi.	It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate without a source or medium-sized animal herd.
549	en	zu	Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.	Ngaphambi kokuthi kuxoxwe ngemisuka eyizilwane yama-HCoV, kuzosiza ukuthi sixoxe ngezincazelo nezici zababungazi boshintsho, abangokwemvelo, abawumthombo, abamaphakathi nabokukhulisa ama-HCoV.	Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will help us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the variable, natural, source, intermediate and amplifier HCoVs.
550	en	zu	An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.	Isilwane siba umbungazi woshintsho we-HCoV uma sifukamele ukhokho ohlobene ngokuseduze okwabelwana naye nge-homology ephakeme ezingeni lokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	An animal becomes the host of HCoV changes when it becomes a closely related ancestor shared with high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
551	en	zu	The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.	Igciwane eliwukhokho livame ukuzivumelanisa kahle futhi alikubangeli ukugula kulo mbungazi.	The ancestral virus tends to adapt well and does not cause illness in this host.
552	en	zu	Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.	Ngokufanayo, umbungazi owumthombo ufukamela i-HCoV ngokuqhubekayo futhi isikhathi eside.	Similarly, the source host bows to HCoV continuously and for a long time.
553	en	zu	In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.	Kuzo zombili izimo, ababungazi batheleleka ngokwemvelo futhi bangababungazi abangokwemvelo be-HCoV noma igciwane layo elingumzali.	In both cases, the unknowings are naturally infected and are not natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
554	en	zu	In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.	Ngokuphambene nalokho, uma i-HCoV yethulwa kabusha kumbungazi omaphakathi ngaphambili noma ngasekwethulweni kubantu, ayizivumelanisile kahle nombungazi omusha futhi ngokuvamile ibangela ukugula.	On the contrary, if HCoV is re-introduced to a central host before or by introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and often causes illness.
555	en	zu	This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.	Lo mbungazi omaphakathi angase abe umthombo oyi-zoonotic yokutheleleka kwabantu futhi adlale indima yokukhulisa umbungazi okuvumela igciwane ukuthi liphindeke isikhashana futhi lidluliselwe kubantu ukuze kukhuliswe izinga lokutheleleka kwabantu.	This intermediate host may be a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role in developing a host that allows the virus to be temporarily replicated and transmitted to humans to increase the rate of infection.
556	en	zu	An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.	I-HCoV ingabhekana nokutheleleka kokugcina uma ingakwazi ukulondoloza ukutheleleka kwayo ngaphakathi kombungazi omaphakathi.	HCoV can face final exposure if it is unable to maintain its infiltration within the central host.
557	en	zu	On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.	Ngokuphambene nalokho, ama-HCoV ayakwazi ukuzivumelanisa nombungazi omaphakathi futhi aze asungule ne-endemicity yesikhathi eside.	On the contrary, HCoVs are able to adapt to a medium-term host and even establish long-term endemicity.
558	en	zu	In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.	Kulesi simo, umbungazi omaphakathi uba umbungazi owumthombo ongokwemvelo.	In this state, the central host becomes a natural source.
559	en	zu	Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.	Idatha ye-epidemiological yabonisa ukuthi lapho kubhekwa emuva ukuthi isiguli esiyinkomba ye-SARS sasinomlando wokuxhumana nezilwane ezizingelwayo.	Epidemiological data showed that looking back that the SARS-indexed patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
560	en	zu	Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.	Izingcwaningo ze-seroprevalence ezalandela zabonisa ukuthi abahwebi bezilwane babe ne-IgG emelene SARS-CoV ephakeme uma beqhathaniswa nesibalo sabantu abavamile.	Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that animal traders had higher IgG against SARS-CoV compared to the average population.
561	en	zu	Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.	Ama-masked palm civet (i-paguma larvata) kanye nenja ye-racoon ezimakethe zezilwane eziphilayo kwatholwa ukuthi athwala amagciwane afana nawe-SARS-CoV acishe afane ne-SARS-CoV.	Masked palm civet (paguma larvata) and racoon dog in live animal markets were found to carry viruses like SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
562	en	zu	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.	Lokhu kwasekelwa ngokungaqondile iqiniso lokuthi ayikho i-SARS eyengeziwe eyabikwa ngemva kokubulawa kwawo wonke ama-civet ezimakethe.	This was indirectly based on the fact that no additional SARS was reported after the killing of all civets in the market.
563	en	zu	However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.	Nokho, kuye kwabikwa ukuthi ama-masked palm civet asendle noma emapulazini angakaze achayeke ezimakethe zezilwane eziphilayo ayenegethivu uma kuziwa ku-SARS-CoV, okusikisela ukuthi ama-masked palm civet angase abe umbungazi wokukhulisa omaphakathi kodwa hhayi umthombo ongokwemvelo we-SARS-CoV.	However, it has been reported that masked palm civets in the wild or on farms that have never recovered from live animal markets were negative when it comes to SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be a medium-sized breeding herd but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
564	en	zu	Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.	Kuyaphawuleka, ukuthi u-80% wezilwane ezihlukahlukene ezimakethe zase-Guangzhou zinezivikeli-mzimba ezimelene ne-SARS-CoV, asikwazi ukushalazela ithuba lokuthi izilwane eziningi ezincelisayo zingababungazi abakhulisayo abamaphakathi be-SARS-CoV.	Notably, that 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies against SARS-CoV, we cannot lament the possibility that many mammals may not be the main breeders of SARS-CoV.
565	en	zu	All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.	Zonke lezi zibonakala zingababungazi bokugcina be-SARS-CoV.	All of these appear to be final cases of SARS-CoV.
566	en	zu	Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.	Ucwaningo olwalandela lombungazi oyisilwane esingokwemvelo se-SARS-CoV lwaveza i-CoV ehlobene ngokuseduze nelulwane, ebizwa ngokuthi i-SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), etholakala kumalulwane abizwa ngesicathulo sehhashi ase-Chine.	A subsequent study of the natural animal host SARS-CoV revealed a coV closely related to the bat, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in bats called Chinese horse shoe.
567	en	zu	These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.	Lawa malulwane aphozithivu uma kuziwa kuzivikeli-mzimba ezimelene ne-SARS-CoV kanye nokulandelana kwezakhi zofuzo ze-SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.	These are mild bats when it comes to the immune system that is resistant to SARS-CoV and the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
568	en	zu	This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.	Le kanye namanye ama-CoV elulwane abelana ngo-88-92% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide ne-SARS-CoV.	This and other coV in the bat share 88-92% homology of nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV.
569	en	zu	These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.	Lezi zingcwaningo ziholele ekusungulweni kombono omusha wokuthi amalulwane abungaza ama-pathogen amasha abantu.	These studies have led to the introduction of a new view that bats can be new human pathogens.
570	en	zu	Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.	Ama-CoV afana ne-SARS (ama-SL-CoV) aphawulwe kumalulwane, kodwa awekho ngaphandle kwaleyo ebizwa ngokuthi i-WIV1 akwazi ukuhlukaniswa njengegciwane eliphilayo.	SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV) are identified in bats, but none other than the so-called WIV1 can be classified as a living virus.
571	en	zu	Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.	I-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (I-ACE2) yabantu yaziwa njengesisabeli se-SARS-CoV.	Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a SARS-CoV respondnt.
572	en	zu	WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry.	I-WIV1 ethathwe kusampula lendle yamalulwane kwaboniswa ukuthi isebenzisa ilulwane, i-civet kanye ne-ACE2 yabantu njengesisabeli sokungena kuseli.	WIV1 taken from a wild sample of bats was shown to use the human bat, civet and ACE2 as an entry-cell solution.
573	en	zu	Intriguingly, sera of convalescent SARS patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1.	Ngokuthakazelisayo, i-sera yeziguli ezilulame ku-SARS yayikwazi ukubulala i-WIV1.	Interestingly, the sera of patients who milded SARS was able to kill WIV1.
574	en	zu	Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.	Kuze kube manje, i-WIV1 imelele ukhokho ohlobene ngokuseduze we-SARS-CoV kumalulwane, yabelana ngo-95% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	Until now, WIV1 represents the closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology of nucleotide sequences.
575	en	zu	Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.	Nakuba kune-homology ephakeme phakathi kwalawa magciwane amabili, kukholelwa ngokuvamile ukuthi i-WIV1 ayilona igciwane elingumzali oseduze we-SARS-CoV futhi amalulwane awayena umbungazi oseduze we-SARS-CoV.	Although there is high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a close parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats had a close host of SARS-CoV.
576	en	zu	Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.	Ukuhlaziywa kwe-phylogenetic kuhlanganisa i-MERS-CoV neqembu elifanayo nelulwane le-CoV-HKU4 kanye nelulwane le-CoV-HKU5.	Phylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CoV and the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
577	en	zu	Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.	I-CoV-HKU4 yelulwane kanye ne-MERS-CoV kusebenzisa isisabeli sombungazi esifanayo, i-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), ekungeneni kwegciwane.	CoV-HKU4 for bats and MERS-CoV uses a similar host agent, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
578	en	zu	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.	Ukulandelana kwe-polymerase ye-RNA ethembele ku-RNA ye-MERS-CoV isondelene ngoku-phylogenetically kozakwabo bama-beta-CoV elulwane atholwe e-Europe nase-Africa.	The sequence of RNA polymerase that relies on MERS-CoV RNA is now phylogenetically close to that of relative beta-CoV in the gene found in Europe and Africa.
579	en	zu	Up to now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.	Kuze kube manje, ayikho i-MERS-CoV ephilayo etholakala kumalulwane asendle.	Until now, no live MERS-CoV is found in wild bats.
580	en	zu	MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.	I-MERS-CoV kanye nesihlobo sayo esiseduze i-CoV-HKU25 yelulwane kwabelana kuphela ngo-87% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	MERS-CoV and its close relative CoV-HKU25 bat share only 87% of nucleotide sequencing homology.
581	en	zu	Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.	Ngenxa yalokho, amalulwane angase angabi umbungazi owumthombo oseduze we-MERS-CoV.	As a result, bats may not be a source of the nearest source of MERS-CoV.
582	en	zu	On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, izingcwaningo e-Middle East ziye zabonisa ukuthi amakamela e-dromedary a-seropositive kuzivikeli-mzimba ezibulala i-MERS-CoV ngokuqondile, ngokufana namakamela adabuka e-Middle East emazweni amaningi ase-Afrika.	On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that seropositive dromedary camels in immune system kill MERS-CoV directly, similar to camels that originate in the Middle East in many African countries.
583	en	zu	Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV.	I-MERS-CoV ephilayo efana negciwane elitholwe kubantu yahlukaniswa kuswabhu yasekhaleni yamakamela e-dromedary, okwabonisa ngokuqhubekayo ukuthi amakamela angumbungazi ongumthombo wangempela we-MERS-CoV.	The live MERS-CoV virus found in humans was isolated from the dromedary camel's nose lab, which continuously showed that camels are a real source of MERS-CoV.
584	en	zu	It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.	Kuyaphawuleka futhi ukuthi ngokuvamile kwabonwa izimpawu ezincane kodwa ukukhishwa okukhulu kwegciwane kumakamela athelelekile nge-MERS-CoV ngokocwaningo.	It is also noteworthy that mild symptoms were generally observed but severe infection in camels suspected of MERS-CoV according to the study.
585	en	zu	Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.	Kuyaphawuleka, ukuthi amakamela athelelekile awagcinanga ukukhipha amagciwane ngomgudu wokuphefumula kuphela kodwa futhi nangomgudu wendle-womlomo, okuphinde kube umzila oyinhloko wokukhishwa kwegciwane elivela kumalulwane.	It is noteworthy, that the infected camels not only maintained disinfection through the respiratory system but also through the wild-mouthed system, which is also the main route of disinfection from bats.
586	en	zu	However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.	Nokho, imibuzo isasele njengoba ukugula okuningi kwe-MERS kungenawo umlando wokuxhumana namakamela ngaphambi kokuqala kwezimpawu, kungenzeka ukuthi ukuthelelana okusuka kumuntu kuye komunye noma imizila yokuthelelana engaziwa ehilela izilwane ezingaziwa ezifukamela i-MERS-CoV.	However, questions remain as many MERS infections have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it is possible that human-to-human interactions or unknown contact traces involve unknown animals infecting MERS-CoV.
587	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.	I-SARS-CoV-2 yabelana nge-homology ye-nucleotide engu-96.2% ne-CoV RaTG13 yelulwane ehlukaniswe kumalulwane e-Rhinolophus affinis.	SARS-CoV-2 shares a nucleotide homology of 96.2% with CoV RaTG13 of a bat isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
588	en	zu	As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.	Njengoba kunjalo nge-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV, ukuhlukahluka kokulandelana phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-RaTG13 kukhulu kakhulu ukuthi kungabelwa ubudlelwano bomzali.	As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be divided into parent relationships.
589	en	zu	That is to say, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.	Lokho kusho ukuthi, amalulwane kungenzeka ukuthi awayena umbungazi owumthombo oseduze we-SARS-CoV-2 ngaphandle kwalapho kutholwa ama-CoV elulwane acishe afane esikhathini esizayo.	That is to say, bats may have had a near-source host of SARS-CoV-2 unless coVs were found in the nest almost identical in the future.
590	en	zu	Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicative of a probable animal-to-human transmission event.	Kucatshangelwa ukuthi, ababungazi besilwane esimaphakathi se-SARS-CoV-2 kufanele babe phakathi kwezilwane zasendle ezidayiswa futhi zibulawe e-Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, iningi lazo lalihlobene nokugula kokuqala kwe-COVID-19, okubonisa ukuthi kungenzeka ukuthi kwaba nesenzakalo sokuthelelana okusuka kuzilwane kuye kubantu.	Presumably, the relatives of the central ANIMAL SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the initial COVID-19 outbreak, suggesting that there may have been an event of contact from animals to humans.
591	en	zu	Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.	Izingcwaningo zakamuva ezimbalwa ezisekelwe ekulandelaneni kwe-metagenomic ziye zasikisela ukuthi iqembu lezilwane ezincane ezincelisayo ezaziwa ngokuthi ama-pangolin (i-Manis javanica) kungenzeka ukuthi zifukamele ama-beta-CoV amadala ahlobene ne-SARS-CoV-2.	A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) are likely to be prone to older beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
592	en	zu	These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.	Lawa ma-genome amasha e-pangolin CoV abelana ngo-85-92% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide ne-SARS-CoV-2.	These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequencing with SARS-CoV-2.
593	en	zu	However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.	Nokho, ahlobene ngokuseduze ngokulinganayo ne-RaTG13 ngomazisi ocishe ube ngu-90% ezingeni lokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with an almost 90% nucleotide sequence level.
594	en	zu	They cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.	Ahlangana abe yizinhlu ezingaphansi ezimbili zamagciwane acishe afane ne-SARS-CoV-2 esihlahleni esi-phylogenetic, esinye sazo sabelana ngesizinda sokunamathisela sesisabeli esifana kakhulu (i-RBD) ne-SARS-CoV-2, nokufana kokulandelana kwe-amino acid okungu-97.4%.	They met into two sub-clusters of viruses almost identical to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shared a very similar reactor attachment base (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of amino acids of 97.4%.
595	en	zu	In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.	Ngokungafani okukhulu, ama-RBD e-SARS-CoV-2 ne-RaTG13 ahlukene kakhulu, nakuba kunezinga eliphakeme le-genome ebanzi yokulandelana kwe-homology.	In great contrast, rbds for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a higher genome-wide rate of homology sequencing.
596	en	zu	An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.	Ucwaningo lwangaphambilini lwama-pangolin agulayo lwabika ukutholwa kwama-contig egciwane kumasampula amaphaphu, okubonakala ehlobene ngokufanayo ne-SARS-CoV-2.	Previous studies of sick pangolins reported the discovery of viral contig in lung samples, which appear to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
597	en	zu	This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.	Lolu cwaningo lwasebenzisa izindlela zokwakhiwa ezihlukahlukene kanye nokuhlelwa okwenziwa ngesandla ukuze kwakhiwe ukulandelana kwe-genome eyingxenye eyakhiwa cishe u-86.3% wobude obuphelele be-genome yegciwane.	This study used a variety of structural methods and manual editing to build a partial genome sequence composed of approximately 86.3% of the total genome length of the virus.
598	en	zu	We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.	Asikwazi ukubekela eceleni ithuba lokuthi i-pangolin ingesinye sezilwane ezingababungazi abaseduze be-SARS-CoV-2.	We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the nearest unknown animals of SARS-CoV-2.
599	en	zu	However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.	Nokho, okwamanje abukho ubufakazi obusekela ukuthi i-pangolin ingumsuka oqondile we-SARS-CoV-2 ngenxa yokuhlukahluka kokulandelana phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolin ehlobene nama-beta-CoV.	However, there is currently no evidence to support that pangolin is a direct source of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequencing variations between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin related beta-CoV.
600	en	zu	In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, ibanga eliphakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-RaTG13 lifushane nakakhulu phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolini ehlobene nama-beta-CoV.	Furthere, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolini related beta-CoV.
601	en	zu	The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.	Umgudu wokuziphendukela we-SARS-CoV-2 kumalulwane, ama-pangolin nezinye izilwane ezincelisayo usazotholwa.	The self-conversion system of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be detected.
602	en	zu	Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.	Nakuba i-homology yokulandelana okuphakeme itholiwe kuma-RBD phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ne-pangolin, i-SARS-CoV-2 ehlobene nama-beta-CoV, i-SARS-CoV-2 ne-RaTG13 kwabelana nge-homology ephakeme yokulandelana kwe-genome ebanzi.	Although high sequencing homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share higher homology for broader genome sequencing.
603	en	zu	It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.	Kunezinsolo eziphakeme zokuthi izinga eliphakeme lokufana phakathi kwama-RBD e-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolini ehlobene nama-beta-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 kuqhutshwa ukuziphendukela kokuhlangana okuxhumana ngokukhethwa.	There are high reports that the high level of similarity between THE RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 pangolini related to beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the self-expression of contact interactions by choice.
604	en	zu	A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.	Esinye isiphakamiso sincoma ukuhlanganiswa kabusha okuphakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolini ehlobene ne-beta-CoV kanye ne-RaTG13 kusilwane sesithathu sasendle.	Another proposal recommends a regrouping between SARS-CoV-2 pangolini-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal.
605	en	zu	As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.	Njengamandla aqhuba ukuziphendukela, ukuhlanganiswa kabusha kusakazekile phakathi kwama-beta-CoV.	As energy drives self-conversion, re-integration is spread among beta-CoV.
606	en	zu	The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.	Isiphetho asikafinyelelwa ngokuqondene nomsuka we-zoonotic eseduze ye-SARS-CoV-2.	The conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the nearest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
607	en	zu	Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.	Ngaphandle kwama-HCoV a-pathogenic kakhulu, umsuka we-zoonotic ye-HCoV-229E, i-HCoV-OC43, i-HCoV-NL63 kanye ne-HCoV-HKU1 nawo ucwaningiwe.	Besides highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
608	en	zu	Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.	Ubufakazi be-phylogenetic bubonise ukuthi kokubili i-HCoV-NL63 kanye ne-HCoV-229E kungenzeka ukuthi kwaqala kuma-CoV elulwane, kuyilapho amagciwane angumzali e-HCoV-OC43 kanye ne-HCoV-HKU1 etholwe kumagundane.	Phylogenetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have started in CoV in the gene, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mice.
609	en	zu	It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.	Kubikwe ukuthi i-CoV yelulwane ebizwa ngokuthi i-ARCoV.2 (i-Appalachian Ridge CoV) etholwe elulwaneni elinemibala emithathu laseNyakatho Melika yabonisa ubudlelwano obuseduze ne-HCoV-NL63.	It was reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in a three-colored North American cage showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
610	en	zu	On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, i-HCoV-229E yayihlobene ngokwezakhi zofuzo nenye i-CoV yelulwane, ebizwa ngokuthi i-Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, eyatholwa e-Ghana, kuyilapho ama-camelid aye asolwa ngokuba umbungazi wayo oseduze.	On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, while camelids have been accused of being its nearest host.
611	en	zu	For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2.	Ukuze sicacise, ulwazi lwamanje oluphathelene nemisuka eyizilwane yama-HCoV aziwayo lufinyezwe Kumfanekiso ​1 kanye Nethebula 2.	To clarify, current information regarding the origins of known HCoV animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
612	en	zu	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.	Ukuhlaziywa kwe-phylogenetic kunikeze ubufakazi bezigameko zokuthelelana kwezidalwa zama-HCoV emlandweni.	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of instances of interdesation of HCoV creatures in history.
613	en	zu	When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.	Ngenkathi i-HCoV-OC43 isuka kwesinye isilwane ukuze idluliselwe kubantu yasuka ezilwaneni ezifuywayo cishe ngo-1890, kwaqoshwa ubhubhane lwesifo sokuphefumula .	When HCoV-OC43 moved from another animal to be transmitted to humans from pets about 1890, a respiratory disease epidemic was recorded.
614	en	zu	The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.	Umlando wokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezihlukahlukene we-HCoV-229E awucacile kakhulu.	The history of interdede into interdeficance of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
615	en	zu	Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.	Kutholwe ama-alpha-CoV elulwane ahlobenene-HCoV-229E.	Alpha-CoV has been found in a relative hcov-229E.
616	en	zu	Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.	Phakathi kwawo kukhona i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca.	Among them is alpaca alpha-CoV.
617	en	zu	Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.	Ubufakazi obumbalwa busekela ukudluliswa kwegciwane lisuka emalulwaneni liye kubantu ngokuqondile.	A few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
618	en	zu	First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.	Okokuqala, abantu hhayi ama-alpaca kungenzeka ukuthi baxhumane namalulwane endaweni ezungezile efanayo.	First, humans not alpacas are likely to interact with bats in the same surrounding area.
619	en	zu	Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.	Kunalokho, abantu abasondelana ngokuseduze nama-alpaca.	Rather, people are closer to alpacas.
620	en	zu	Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.	Okwesibili, ama-alpha-CoV elulwane ahlobene ne-HCoV-229E ahlukahlukene futhi awakubangeli ukugula kumalulwane, kuyilapho i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca yabangela ukubheduka kwesifo sokuphefumula kuzilwane ezithelelekile.	Secondly, alpha-CoV in the bat is related to various HCoV-229E and does not cause illness in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory disease mutations in infected animals.
621	en	zu	Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.	Okugcina, i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca ayikatholwa kuzilwane zasendle.	Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.
622	en	zu	Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.	Ngenxa yalokho, ngeke silishalazele ithuba lokuthi ama-alpaca athola i-alpha-CoV ehlobene ne-HCoV-229E kubantu.	As a result, we will not worry about the possibility that alpacas receive alpha-CoV related HCoV-229E in humans.
623	en	zu	In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.	Eqinisweni, amalulwane awumthombo oqondile wamagciwane abangela ukugula kwabantu okuhlanganisa igciwane lamarabi, igciwane le-Ebola, igciwane le-Nipah kanye negciwane le-Hendra.	In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that cause human illnesses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
624	en	zu	It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.	Ngakho akumangalisi ukuthi amalulwane kungenzeka adlulisele i-HCoV-229E kubantu ngokuqondile.	So it is not surprising that bats are likely to transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
625	en	zu	Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, lapho ama-alpha-CoV elulwane esebenza njengeqoqo lezakhi zofuzo ze-HCoV-229E, ama-alpaca kanye namakamela e-dromedary kungenzeka ukuthi angumbungazi omaphakathi odlulisela igciwane kubantu, njengoba kunjalo nge-MERS-CoV.	On the other hand, when alpha-CoV in the gene acts as a cluster of HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and dromedary camels are likely to be the central host that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
626	en	zu	MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.	I-MERS-CoV iyisibonelo esihle sokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezingafani kusukela kumalulwane kuye kumakamela e-dromedary kuye kubantu.	MERS-CoV is a good example of the interaction of different creatures from bats to dromedary camels to humans.
627	en	zu	The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.	Umsuka wokuziphendukela kwe-MERS-CoV evela kumalulwane uyaziwa ekuhlonzweni kwayo kokuqala futhi uqiniswe ngokutholiwe okulandelayo.	The origin of MERS-CoV mutations from bats is known for its early detection and reinforced by subsequent detection.
628	en	zu	It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.	Kusobala ukuthi amalulwane anikeza izinhlobonhlobo zamagciwane ithuba lokuthi kube nokushintshana kwezingxenye zezakhi zofuzo phakathi kwezilwane ezihlukene kanye nokuthelelana kwezilwane ezihlukene.	It is clear that bats provide a variety of viruses with the opportunity for the exchange of genetic components between different animals and the interaction of different animals.
629	en	zu	Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'.	Impilo ende, amakoloni aminyene, ukusondelana komphakathi okuseduze kanye nekhono elinamandla lokundiza konke kuyizimo ezikahle zokuthi amalulwane abe 'umbhebhethekisi wegciwane' okahle.	Long life, dense colonies, close social proximity and strong flying ability are all ideal conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus bubble'.
630	en	zu	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, sekungamakhulu eminyaka i-MERS-CoV yethulwe kumakamela e-dromedary.	On the other hand, for hundreds of years MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels.
631	en	zu	It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.	Ivumelaniseke kahle kulawa makamela aphenduke ekubeni umbungazi omaphakathi aba umbungazi ozinzile nongumthombo ongokwemvelo.	It is well suited to these camels that turn into a central host that becomes a stable and natural source.
632	en	zu	MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.	I-MERS-CoV ibangela ukugula okuncane futhi inezinga lokushintsha eliphansi kulezi zilwane.	MERS-CoV causes mild illness and has a low change rate in these animals.
633	en	zu	Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.	Ukutheleleka kwayo kubantu kuyiphutha futhi abantu bahlala bengumbungazi wokugcina we-MERS-CoV njengoba ukudluliswa kwayo kungakwazi ukulondolozwa.	Its human exposure is flawed and humans remain the ultimate host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be maintained.
634	en	zu	In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.	Ngokungafani nendima yamakamela ekudlulisweni kwe-MERS-CoV, indima yama-pangolin, uma ikhona, ekudlulisweni kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ihlukile.	Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
635	en	zu	Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.	Ngokukhethekile, ama-beta-CoV e-pangolin abangela ukugula kakhulu kuma-pangolin.	Specifically, pangolin beta-CoV causes severe illness in pangolins.
636	en	zu	They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.	Angase abe umbungazi wokugcina wama-beta-CoV ahlobene ne-SARS-CoV-2, ngokufana nama-civet esimweni se-SARS-CoV.	It may be the final host of SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
637	en	zu	Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.	Amathuba ambalwa okuthelelana kwezidalwa ezingafani nge-SARS-CoV-2 kusukela ezilwaneni kuye kubantu kufanele zicatshangelwe noma zingacatshangelwa kuzingcwaningo zesikhathi esizayo.	A few chances of intersolung interdesation of non-SARS-CoV-2 organisms from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
638	en	zu	First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.	Okokuqala, amalulwane kungenzeka abe umbungazi ongumthombo wegciwane elihlobene ne-SARS-CoV-2 elicishe lifane ne-SARS-CoV-2.	First, bats are likely to be the source host of a VIRUS related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
639	en	zu	Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.	Abantu bangase badlale indima efanayo namalulwane ngokuhlinza izilwane noma ukumbiwa kwamalahle.	Humans may play a similar role to bats in animal surgery or coal mining.
640	en	zu	Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.	Okwesibili, ama-pangolin angase abe umbungazi okhulisayo omaphakathi lapho igciwane elihlobene ne-SARS-CoV-2 lisanda kwethulwa khona.	Second, pangolins may be the central amplifier host where the SARS-CoV-2-related virus was recently introduced.
641	en	zu	Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.	Abantu batheleleka ngegciwane ngokuhlinza nokudla inyama ezingelwayo.	People are infected with the virus by surgically eating unbled meat.
642	en	zu	It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.	Kungenzeka ukuthi izilwane eziningi ezincelayo okuhlanganisa nezilwane ezifuywayo zingachayeka ku-SARS-CoV-2.	It is possible that many mammals including pets may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
643	en	zu	A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.	Kudingeka inhlolovo yezivikeli-mzimba zezilwane ezifuywayo nezasendle.	An examination of the immune system of pets and wild animals is required.
644	en	zu	Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.	Okwesithathu, njengoba kushiwo ngenhla, ukuhlanganiswa kabusha nokuvunyelaniswa nesimo kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kungenzeka kwenzeke esilwaneni sesithathu esixhumene nakho kokubili amalulwane nama-pangolin.	Third, as mentioned above, regrouping and synchronization with the status of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur in a third animal associated with both bats and pangolins.
645	en	zu	The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.	Ukucingwa kwesilwane esiwumsuka we-SARS-CoV-2 kusaqhubeka.	The diagnosis of the animal at the root of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
646	en	zu	Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.	Ngaphandle kwezinhlobo ezihlukahlukene zababungazi abayizilwane, kunezici ezintathu ezinkulu ohlangothini lwegciwane ezibalulekile ekwenzeni ama-CoV eqe umngcele wezidalwa.	Besides the variety of animal mammals, there are three major characteristics on the viral side that are essential for making CoVs cross the boundary of creatures.
647	en	zu	First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.	Okokuqala, inani lawo eliphakeme loshintsho ekuphindweni kwe-RNA.	First, their highest number of changes in RNA replication.
648	en	zu	In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts.	Uma kuqhathaniswa namanye amagciwane e-RNA anomucu owodwa, isilinganiso samanani oshintsho lwama-CoV singase sibhekwe “njengesincane” kuye “kwesiphakeme” ngokwesilinganiso soshintsho esingu ~10-4 unyaka ngamunye ngesikhungo ngasinye sesi-2, kuye ngesigaba sokuvumelanisa kwe-CoV kubabungazi abasha.	"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the ratio of the number of CoV changes may be considered ""small"" to ""high"" on a change rate of ~10-4 each year for each 2 center, depending on the coV synchronization phase for new acquaintances."
649	en	zu	CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.	Ama-CoV ane-exoribonuclease yokufuna amaphutha, ukususwa kwayo kuphumela ekushintsheni okuphakeme kakhulu nasekwehleni kwamandla noma ukungakwazi ukukhula ngendlela efanele.	CoVs have fault-seeking exoribonuclease, whose removal results in a very high change and decrease in strength or inability to grow properly.
650	en	zu	Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.	Ngokuthakazelisayo, i-nucleotide analogue Remdesivir iyaziwa ukuthi icindezela ukuphindeka kwe-CoV ngokuvinjwa kwale exoribonuclease kanye ne-RNA polymerase encike ku-RNA.	Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
651	en	zu	Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.	I-Remdesivir ingenye yama-ejenti athembisa kakhulu alwa ne-SARS-CoV-2 ezohlolwa kuzingcwaningo zokwelashwa.	Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be evaluated in clinical studies.
652	en	zu	Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.	Noma kunjalo, amanani oshintsho lwama-CoV aphakeme cishe ngesigidi kunalawo ababungazi.	However, CoV exchange rates are about a million higher than those they did not know.
653	en	zu	In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, inani loshintsho livame ukuba phezulu uma ama-CoV engavumelanisiwe kahle nombungazi.	Additionally, the number of changes tends to be higher if COVs are not properly synchronized with the host.
654	en	zu	Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.	Uma kuqhathaniswa ne-SARS-CoV enenani loshintsho eliphakeme, inani loshintsho le-SARS-CoV-2 libonakala liphansi, okusikisela izinga eliphezulu lokuvunyelaniswa nabantu.	Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher exchange rate, the exchange rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of human synchronization.
655	en	zu	Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.	Kucatshangelwa ukuthi, kungenzeka selivunyelanisiwe kakade nomunye umbungazi osondelene nabantu.	Presumably, it may already have been approved by another person close to the public.
656	en	zu	In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.	Ngaphezu kwe-SARS-CoV-2, lokhu kuphinde kusebenze ku-MERS-CoV, evumelana kahle namakamela e-dromedary.	In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also works in MERS-CoV, which is well compatible with dromedary camels.
657	en	zu	Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.	Kucatshangelwa ukuthi cishe akunakwenzeka ukuthi ushintsho lwezakhi zofuzo lungabangela imigomo nemishanguzo yamagciwane emelene ne-SARS-CoV-2 ukuthi ingasebenzi ngokushesha.	It is thought that it is unlikely that genetic changes could cause the rules and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to be ineffective immediately.
658	en	zu	Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.	Okwesibili, i-genome enkulu ye-RNA kuma-CoV isebenzisa ukuthamba okwengeziwe ekushintshweni kwe-genome kushintsho nokuhlanganiswa kabusha, ngaleyo ndlela kunyuswe ithuba le-co-evolution yezidalwa ezihlukahlukene, elizuzisayo ekuveleni kwama-CoV amasha lapho izimo zifaneleka.	Secondly, the larger RNA genome in CoVs uses more flexibility in genome modification and regrouping, thereby increased the chance of co-evolution of various organisms, which benefits from the development of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
659	en	zu	This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.	Lokhu kusekelwa amafreyimu ahlukile amaningi okufunda avulekile nokusebenza kwephrotheni akhiqizelwa isiphetho esingu-3′ se-genome.	This is based on many different open learning frames and protein activity produced by the 3′ end of the genome.
660	en	zu	Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.	Okwesithathu, ama-CoV ahlalal ashintsha amathempulethi ngokungahleliwe phakathi nokuphindwa kwe-RNA ngendlela ehlukile “yokukhetha-kokukopisha”.	"Third, residential CoVs randomly alter templates during RNA replication in a different ""choice-copying"" way."
661	en	zu	In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.	Kumbungazi osebenza njengesitsha sokuxuba, ukushintsha kohlobo kwenzeka njalo phakathi ne-transcription ye-CoV RNA.	For a host that acts as a mixing vessel, a type change occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
662	en	zu	Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.	Ama-RNA a-homologous kakhulu anobude obugcwele kanye na-subgenomic angase ahlangane kabusha ukuze akhe ama-CoV amasha.	Highly homologous RNAs with full and subgenomic lengths may regroup to form new CoVs.
663	en	zu	Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.	Ubufakazi obuyi-phylogenetic bokuhlanganiswa kabusha okungokwemvelo butholwe kukho kokubili i-HCoV-HKU1, i-HCoV-OC43, kanye nama-CoV esilwane njenge-SL-CoV yelulwane kanye ne-batCoV-HKU9.	Phylogenetic evidence of natural reunification has been found in both HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animal CoVs such as BatL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
664	en	zu	Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission	Ukusebenzisana kwegciwane nombungazi ngokuqondene nokutheleleka	Virus interaction with host regarding infection
665	en	zu	Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.	Ngaphandle kwezici ezintathu zegciwane ezishiwo ngenhla, ukusebenzisana kwegciwane nesisabeli sombungazi kungesinye isici esiyinhloko esinethonya ekuthelelaneni kwezidalwa ezingafani.	Besides the three characteristics of the virus mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host host is another key factor influencing the interaction of different creatures.
666	en	zu	Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.	Lapha, ukuhlanganiswa kabusha kwe-SARS-CoV kubhekwa njengesibonelo esivamile, esabonisa ubufakazi bokukhethwa okuphozithivu phakathi nezehlakalo zokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezihlukene.	Here, the reunification of SARS-CoV is considered a common example, which showed evidence of a positive selection between events of interdestion of different creatures.
667	en	zu	Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.	Ngokusekelwe ekuhlaziyweni okuqhathanisayo phakathi kwabantu abahlukanisiwe kanye nama-SARS-CoV e-civet, kucatshangelwa ukuthi i-SARS-CoV ibhekana nokuvumelana nesimo okusheshayo kubabungazi abahlukene, ikakhulukazi ngoshintsho ku-RBD yephrotheni ka-S.	Based on comparative analysis between isolated populations and CIVET SARS-CoV, it is assumed that SARS-CoV copes with rapid mood acknownowment in different misunderstandings, especially with changes in the RBD of the S protein.
668	en	zu	Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.	Ngokuvamile, i-RBD kuphrotheni ka-S ye-CoV isebenzisana nesisabeli seseli futhi ikhethwa ngokuqinile ukusabela kwesivikeli-mzimba sombungazi.	Generally, RBD in the S protein of CoV interacts with the cell respondor and is strongly selected for the immune response of the host.
669	en	zu	In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.	Ku-SARS-CoV, i-RBD ikuma-amino acid esi-318 kuye kweyesi-510 engxenyeni ye-S1, enamathela ku-ACE2 yomuntu kanye nama-coreceptor ayo ukuze kungene igciwane.	In SARS-CoV, RBD is 318 to 510 amino acids in the S1 component, which adheres to human ACE2 and its coreceptors for the entry of the virus.
670	en	zu	The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.	I-RBD ye-SARS-CoV iyakwazi ukubona izisabeli ze-ACE2 yezilwane ezihlukene, okuhlanganisa ilulwane, i-civet, igundane nenja ye-raccoon, okuvumela ukuthelelana ngegciwane kwezidalwa ezihlukene.	THE RBD of SARS-CoV is able to detect ACE2 reacts of different animals, which include a bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, which allows for virus transmission of different creatures.
671	en	zu	In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.	Eqinisweni, izinsalela ezingu-6 kuphela ze-amino acid okwaphawulwa ukuthi zihlukile kokuhlukanisiwe kwegciwane labantu kanye ne-civet ku-RBD okungu-4 kukho kutholakala ku-motif enamathela kusisabeli ukuze isebenzelane nesisabeli se-ACE2.	In fact, only 6 amino acid residues that were identified as distinct from human virus differentiation and civet in 4 RBDs are found in the coating motif in the reactant to work with the ACE2 respondant.
672	en	zu	Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.	I-SARS-CoV ye-civet inoshintsho lwe-K479N kanye ne-S487T ku-RBD yayo, okungase kunyuse izinga lokuhlangana lokusebenzelana kwephrotheni ye-spike nesisabeli se-ACE2 yomuntu.	The SARS-CoV civet has a K479N and S487T switch to its RBD, which may increase the interplay rate of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 respondor.
673	en	zu	In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.	Ngamanye amazwi, lolu shintsho lwama-amino acid amabili lungase lubaluleke ekuvumelanisweni kwegciwane kubantu.	In other words, this change of two amino acids may be important for the synchronization of the virus in humans.
674	en	zu	It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.	Kuyaphawuleka ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 inesisabeli esifanayo seseli ne-SARS-CoV.	It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell cell reaction as SARS-CoV.
675	en	zu	A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.	Umehluko ka-30% phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ne-SARS-CoV kuyunithi ye-S1 yephrotheni ka-S usho ukuthi izinga lokuhlangana lephrotheni lika-S ne-ACE2 yabantu kungenzeka ukuthi lishintshile.	The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the concentration rate of human S and ACE2 proteins is likely to have changed.
676	en	zu	Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.	Empeleni, ucwaningo lwe-cryo-EM libonisa izinga eliphakeme lokugoqa okungu-10- ukuya ku-20- lalokhu kugoqa kunalokho okuphakathi kwe-ACE2 yabantu nephrotheni ka-S ye-SARS-CoV.	In fact, the cryo-EM study shows a high level of 10- to 20- of this wrap is rather between human ACE2 and the S protein sars-CoV.
677	en	zu	It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.	Kuzophinde futhi kuthakazelise ukunquma ukuthi ingabe iyadingeka yini enye i-coreceptor ekuthelelekeni kwe-SARS-CoV-2.	It will also be interesting to determine whether another coreceptor is needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
678	en	zu	Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S.	Ngokuthakazelisayo, i-HCoV-NL63 iphinde inamathele ku-ACE2 kodwa ngengxenye ehlukile ka-S.	Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also attached to ACE2 but with a different s component.
679	en	zu	There exist many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.	Kukhona ezinye izisabeli ze-HCoV, njengama-aminopeptidase N e-HCoV-229E, kanye ne-9-O-acetylated sialic acid ye-HCoV-OC43.	There are other HCoV reacts, such as the aminopeptidase N of HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-acetylated sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.
680	en	zu	They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.	Angase futhi abhekwe njengesizathu sokuzivumelanisa ngempumelelo kwama-CoV kubantu ngemva kokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezihlukene esuka kubabungazi bawo abayizilwane.	They may also be viewed as a reason for the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after the interdesation of different creatures from their animal acquaintances.
681	en	zu	In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.	Ngaphezu kwezisabeli ezingamaseli, umphumela wokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezihlukene ngama-HCoV uphinde futhi ulawulwe ukuncika kwesinye isidalwa nezici zomkhawulo.	In addition to cell reacts, the effect of interdede into different creatures by HCoVs is also controlled by reliance on another creature and the characteristics of the limit.
682	en	zu	The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.	Ukwehluka kwalawa maphrotheni ombungazi phakathi kwabantu nababungazi abawumthombo ongokwemvelo wama-HCoV njengamalulwane, amakamela e-dromedary kanye namagundane kungase kubangele umngcele wokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezihlukene.	The differences in these host proteins between humans and strangers that are a natural source of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and mice may cause a boundary of interdesorming of different creatures.
683	en	zu	HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.	Ama-HCoV kufanele athathe izici zokuncika kumnikazi futhi aphazamise izici zokuvimvela kombungazi ukuze kube nokuthelelana kwezidalwa okuyimpumelelo.	HCoVs should take the characteristics of relying on the owner and interfere with the characteristics of the host's appearance in order to have a successful creature interaction.
684	en	zu	In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.	Ngokuqondene nalokhu, izinqumi ezingamangqamuzana kule ndawo ebalulekile yokusebenzelana nombungazi wegciwane zisazobonwa futhi ziphawulwe.	In this regard, molecular decisions in this important area of interaction with the virus host will still be detected and marked.
685	en	zu	An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.	Ukuhlungwa okubanzi kwe-genome okungachemile kokuncika kombungazi kanye nezici zokukhawulwa ze-SARS-CoV-2 ngokusebenzisa ubuchwepheshe besimanje be-CRISPR kungase kuzuzise.	Extensive genome random screening of the host's dependence and the limitation features of SARS-CoV-2 through the current CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
686	en	zu	Emergence of novel HCoVs: back to ground zero	Ukuqhamuka kwama-HCoV amasha: ukubuyela ekuqaleni	Emergence of new HCoVs: getting back to scratch
687	en	zu	The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.	Ukwehlukahluka kwama-CoV elulwane kunikeza amathuba amaningi okuvela kwama-HCoV amasha.	The diversity of coV in the nest offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
688	en	zu	In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.	Ngalo mqondo, ama-CoV elulwane asebenza njengeqoqo lezakhi zofuzo zama-HCoV.	In this sense, the gene CoVs act as a set of genetic components for HCoVs.
689	en	zu	In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, ushintsho olusheshayo kanye nokuhlanganiswa kabusha kwezakhi zofuzo kuphinde kuqhube ukuziphendukela kwe-HCoV futhi kusebenza njengezinyathelo ezimbili ezibalulekile kule nqubo.	Additionally, rapid changes and reunification of genetic components also drive HCoV mutations and act as two important steps in this process.
690	en	zu	For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.	Ngokwesibonelo, ukutholwa noma ukulahleka kwezakhi zofuzo ezenza ikhodi yephrotheni entsha kunamandla okuwashintsha kakhulu ama-phenotype egciwane.	For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up the code for a new protein has the potential to significantly alter viral phenotypes.
691	en	zu	Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.	Phakathi kwamaphrotheni ayinsiza e-SARS-CoV, i-ORF8 kucatshangwa ukuthi ibalulekile ekuzivumelaniseni nabantu, njengoba amagciwane elulwane ahlobene ne-SARS-CoV ahlukaniswa kodwa atholwa ekhiqiza amaphrotheni e-ORF8 ahlukile.	Among the proteins that are useful for SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important for human synchronization, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses are isolated but found to produce different ORF8 proteins.
692	en	zu	A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.	Isici sokususwa kwe-29-nucleotide sama-SARS-CoV sitholwe ezinhlotsheni ezihlukanisiwe ekuqaleni komqedazwe wabantu.	The 29-nucleotide removal feature of SARS-CoV has been found in isolated clusters at the beginning of human menopause.
693	en	zu	This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.	Lokhu kususwa kuhlukanisa i-ORF8 ibe i-ORF8a kanye ne-ORF8b futhi kucatshangwa ukuthi iwushintsho oluzivumelanisayo olukhuthaza ukushintshwa kwababungazi.	This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a synchronization change that encourages the exchange of strangers.
694	en	zu	Besides, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.	Ngaphandle kwalokho, i-SARS-CoV ingase ibe nomlando wokuhlanganiswa kabusha nezinhlu zama-CoV e-alpha kanye ne-gamma, lapho kwatholwa khona inani elikhulu lezindawo zokuhlanganiswe kabusha okuncane ku-RNA polymerase encike ku-RNA.	Besides, SARS-CoV may have a history of regrouping with alpha and gamma CoV lists, where a large number of small regrouping sites were found in RNA polymerase-based RNA.
695	en	zu	Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.	Izindawo zokuhlanganiswa kabusha zatholwa futhi ku-nsp9, engxenyeni enkulu ye-nsp10, nasezingxenyeni ze-nsp14.	Reunification sites were also found in nsp9, a large part of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
696	en	zu	Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.	Ngokufanayo, kuye kwaboniswa ukuthi umqedazwe i-MERS-CoV yabhekana nezehlakalo zokuhlanganiswa kabusha phakathi kwezinhlu ezihlukene, okwenzeka kumakamela e-dromedary e-Saudi Arabia.	Similarly, it has been shown that the mERS-CoV graduate experienced reunification events between different lists, which occurred on dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
697	en	zu	Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which the HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.	Ngaphandle kwe-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV, izehlakalo zokuhlanganiswa kabusha ziye zaphawulwa kwamanye ama-HCoV, lapho ama-HCoVs ehlangana kabusha namanye ama-CoV esilwane kuzakhi zawo zofuzo ezingenaso isakhiwo.	Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, regrouping events have been marked by other HCoVs, where HCoVs reconnect with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genetic components.
698	en	zu	It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.	Kufanele futhi kuqashelwe ukuthi ukukhethwa kokwenziwa kungase kube nesandla ezinguqukweni ezingahlosiwe kuma-genome egciwane, okungase kube umphumela wokukhulula amagciwane ezingcindezeni zokukhetha ezisetshenzisiwe, njengalezo zamasosha omzimba zombungazi.	It should also be noted that synthetic selection may play a role in unintended changes in viral genomes, which may be the result of releasing viruses from the pressures of the choice used, such as those of the host's immune system.
699	en	zu	An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.	Isibonelo sale miphumela siwukulahleka kwe-ORF4 enobude obuphelele kuhlobo lwephrothothayiphu ethi HCoV-229E, ngenxa yokususwa kwe-nucleotide ekabili.	An example of these effects is the loss of long-term ORF4 in the type of protein HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
700	en	zu	While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.	Nakuba i-ORF4 ephelele yabonwa kumagciwane elulwane nekamela ahlobene ne-HCoV-229E, i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca ibonisa ukufakwa kwe-nucleotide eyodwa, okuholela ekushintsheni kwefreyimu.	Although complete ORF4 was observed in animal and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca's alpha-CoV exhibits a single nucleotide insertion, leading to a frame change.
701	en	zu	Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.	Okokugcina kodwa okubalulekile, ukuziphendukela kwama-HCoV amasha kuphinde kuqhutshwe ingcindezi yokukhethwa kubabungazi bayo abawumthombo.	Last but importantly, the evolution of new HCoVs has also driven the pressure of selection on its source ignorance.
702	en	zu	Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.	Zazingekho izimpawu noma kwakunezimpawu ezincane kuphela ezitholiwe lapho amalulwane etheleleka ngama-CoV, okubonisa ukuvumelaniswa okufanayo phakathi kwama-CoV namalulwane.	There were no symptoms or only minor symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a similar correlation between CoVs and bats.
703	en	zu	It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.	Kubonakala sengathi amalulwane avumelaniswe kahle nama-CoV ngokwesakhiwo nendlela yokusebenza.	It seems that bats are well aligned with CoVs structurally and functionally.
704	en	zu	For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.	Ngokwesibonelo, ukuphazamiseka kokusetshenziswa kokusabela okukhuthaza ukuvuvukala kumalulwane kuyinciphisa kalula i-pathology eqaliswa ama-CoV.	For example, interference with the use of inflammatory reactions in bats easily reduces the pathology initiated by COVs.
705	en	zu	Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.	Ngaphandle kwalokho, umsebenzi weseli elingumbulali ongokwemvelo kumalulwane uyacindezelwa ngenxa yokwenyuka kokusabela kwesivimbi sesisabeli seseli elingumbulali ongokwemvelo elithi NKG2/CD94 kanye nezinga lokuboniswa eliphansi lamangqamuzana esigaba I esiyinkimbinkimbi se-histocompatibility.	Besides, the function of the natural killer cell in bats is suppressed due to the increasing reaction of the natural killer cell cell blocker NKG2/CD94 and the low expression rate of phase I cells which is complex for histocompatibility.
706	en	zu	Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, izinga eliphakeme lezidalwa ezisabela kumoya-mpilo (i-ROS) ezakhiwe ngomsebenzi wokugaywa kokudla okuphakeme kwamalulwane kungase kuthinte kokubili ukucindezelwa kokuphindwa kwe-CoV futhi kuthinte ukuhlolwa kwamaphutha nge-exoribonuclease, ngaleyo ndlela kunikeza ingcindezi yokukhethwa yokwakhiwa kwezinhlobo zegciwane ezi-pathogenic kakhulu lapho zethulwa kumbungazi omusha.	Additionally, the high level of oxygen-reacting creatures (ROS) formed by the high food digestion activity of bats may affect both the suppression of CoV replication and affect error testing with exoribonuclease, thereby providing the pressure of selection for the formation of highly pathogenic strains when introduced to the new host.
707	en	zu	More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.	Izinhlobo ze-CoV ezi-pathogenic kakhulu zingase futhi zishintshe ngokuhlanganiswa kabusha, okuholela ekutholweni kwamaphrotheni amasha noma izici zephrotheni zokuvumelaniswa kombungazi.	Highly pathogenic coV strains can also be altered by re-synthesis, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein characteristics for host synchronization.
708	en	zu	Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.	Ngenxa yalokho, akuyona nje inhlanhla ukuthi ama-HCoV amasha amathathu avele emashumini amabili eminyaka edlule.	As a result, it is not just fortunate that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
709	en	zu	CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.	Ama-CoV awagulisani noma abangele izimpawu ezincane kubabungazi bawo abayinhloko njengamalulwane namakamela.	CoVs do not become ill or cause minor symptoms to their main strangers such as bats and camels.
710	en	zu	They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.	Aphindeka ngokushesha ngaphandle kokukhuthaza ukusabela okuqinile kwamasosha omzimba.	They respond quickly without promoting a strong immune response.
711	en	zu	Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.	Lapha kunezimfihlo zokuthi kungani izithwali ezingenazo izimpawu zibonwa nokuthi yini ebangela izimo ezibucayi ekuguleni kwabantu.	Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and why they cause critical conditions in human illness.
712	en	zu	The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.	Izimpawu ezibucayi ngokuyinhloko zibangelwa ukusebenza kakhulu kwamasosha omzimba kanye nesiphepho se-cytokine lapho kunokusabela kwamasosha omzimba okuqinile, umonakalo wamaphaphu uba mkhulu kakhulu.	Critical symptoms are primarily caused by excessive immune function and cytokine storm when there is a strong immune response, lung damage becomes much greater.
713	en	zu	In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.	Ngokuhlukile, kulabo abangazibonisi izimpawu zokugula, ukusabela kwamasosha omzimba kuye kwahlukaniswa kabili ekuphindweni kwe-CoV.	In contrast, for those who do not show symptoms of illness, the immune response has been doubled in CoV replication.
714	en	zu	The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.	Isu elifanayo lokuhlukanisa ukusabela kwamasosha omzimba lingase libe nemiphumela ezuzisayo ekwelashweni okumelene ne-SARS-CoV-2.	A similar strategy to isolate immune responses may have beneficial effects on treatments related to SARS-CoV-2.
715	en	zu	The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.	Ukusabela kwe-interferon kuqine ngokukhethekile kumalulwane.	Interferon reactions are particularly strong in bats.
716	en	zu	Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.	Ngenxa yalokho, ukusetshenziswa kohlobo I lwe-interferon okungenani ezigabeni zokuqala zokutheleleka nge-SARS-CoV-2 kubantu kufanele kuzuzise.	As a result, the use of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be achieved.
717	en	zu	In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, ukusetshenziswa kwe-NLRP3 inflammasome kumalulwane akusebenzi.	Additionally, the use of NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is ineffective.
718	en	zu	By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.	Ngokwalokhu kucabanga, ukuvinjwa kwe-NLRP3 inflammasome nge-MCC950 kungase kube usizo ekwelashweni kwe-COVID-19.	According to this assumption, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19.
719	en	zu	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.	Ukuvela kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kulandela itimu evamile yokuvela kwe-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV.	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common team of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks.
720	en	zu	Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.	Nakuba kutholwe i-beta-CoV yelulwane eyabelana ngo-95% we-nucleotide homology ne-SARS-CoV, kukhona futhi i-CoV yelulwane eyabelana ngo-96% we-nucleotide homology ne-SARS-CoV-2.	Although beta-CoV was found for a bat that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
721	en	zu	Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.	Nakuba ama-civet nezinye izilwane ezimakethe kutholwe ukuthi zifukamela amagciwane afana ne-SARS-CoV, ababungazi abamaphakathi abaseduze be-SARS-CoV-2 abakatholwa.	Although civets and other animals in the market have been found to infect viruses such as SARS-CoV, the nearest intermediates of SARS-CoV-2 have not been detected.
722	en	zu	Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.	Kutholwe ama-beta-CoV e-pangolin anesakhiwo esifanayo ne-SARS-CoV-2, okubonisa ukuthi ama-pangolin kungenzeka ukuthi angabanye ababungazi abamaphakathi noma ama-beta-CoV ama-pangolin angase abe nesandla ezingxenyeni zezakhi zofuzo enguqulweni yokugcina ye-SARS-CoV-2.	Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to have the same structure as SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be some of the intermediate or beta-CoV pangolins that may have a hand in the genetic components in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
723	en	zu	Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.	Yize imibuzo isamile, abukho ubufakazi bokuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 yakhiwe umuntu ngenhloso noma ngephutha.	Although the questions are still standing, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is designed for purpose or error.
724	en	zu	CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.	Ama-CoV abuyele eshashalazini ngenxa yokubheduka kwakamuva kwe-SARS-CoV-2.	CoVs have returned to the theater due to the recent mutation of SARS-CoV-2.
725	en	zu	The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.	Ukucwaningwa kwama-CoV emalulwaneni nezinye izilwane kuwushintshe kakhulu umbono wethu wokubaluleka kwemisuka ye-zoonotic nemithombo eyizilwane yama-HCoV ekuthelelaneni kwabantu.	The study of CoV in bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal sources of HCoV in human interactions.
726	en	zu	Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.	Ubufakazi obusakazekile bubonisa ukuthi i-SARS-CoV, i-MERS-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 inomsuka oyilulwane futhi idluliselwa kubantu ngababungazi abamaphakathi.	Widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a genetic origin and are transmitted to humans by intermediate acquaintances.
727	en	zu	Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.	Njengoba ukutheleleka nge-SARS-CoV kusuka ekuthintaneni okuphakathi kwabantu nama-civet ezimakethe, ukuvala izimakethe zezilwane eziphilayo nokubulala ama-civet kwakungase kuqede umqedazwe we-SARS.	Given the prevalence of SARS-CoV from human-civet contact in the market, closing live animal markets and killing civets could have ended the SARS eradication.
728	en	zu	By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.	Ngokucabanga okufanayo, ama-pangolin kufanele akhishwe ezimakethe ezidayisa izinto eziphilayo ukuze kuvinjelwe ukutheleleka oku-zoonotic, kucatshangelwa ukutholwa kwezinhlu eziningi zama-beta-CoV e-pangolin ahlobene ngokuseduze ne-SARS-CoV-2.	With the same in mind, pangolins should be released from biological markets to prevent zoonotic infection, assuming the discovery of multiple pangolin beta-CoV lists closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
729	en	zu	However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.	Nokho, ukuthi iyadluliselwa yini nokuthi idluliselwa kanjani i-SARS-CoV-2 kubantu ngama-pangolin nezinye izilwane ezincelisayo kusazocaciswa ezingcwaningweni zesikhathi esizayo.	However, whether it is transmitted and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals will still be explained at future studies.
730	en	zu	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, i-MERS-CoV ibilokhu ikhona kumakamela e-dromedary isikhathi eside.	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
731	en	zu	These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.	Lawa makamela ayithuluzi elibalulekile lezokuthutha kanye nomthombo oyinhloko wenyama, ubusi, isikhumba nemikhiqizo kavolo kubantu basendaweni.	These camels are an important transport tool and the main source of meat, bees, skin and flavor products for local people.
732	en	zu	They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.	Asakazeke kabanzi e-Middle East nase-Africa.	They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
733	en	zu	It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.	Ngakho kuyinto engenakwenzeka ukuthi kubulawe wonke amakamela ukuze kulawulwe i-MERS, njengoba kwenzeka ezimakethe zezilwane zasendle e-China ukuze kuvinjwe ukusakazeka kwe-SARS-CoV ne-SARS-CoV-2.	It is therefore unlikely that all camels will be killed to control MERS, as is the case in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
734	en	zu	To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.	Ukuze kuvinjwe ukubheduka okuphindayo kwe-MERS, kufanele kusetshenziswe indlela eningilizayo ukuze kwakhiwe imigomo esebenzayo emelene ne-MERS-CoV yamakamela, ehambisana nezinye izinyathelo zokulawula isifo.	In order to prevent repeated mERS mutations, a detailed approach should be used to build effective strategies against camel MERS-CoV, which is in line with other disease control measures.
735	en	zu	As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks.	Njengoba singakwazi ukuqeda lawa magciwane, ama-genotype amasha angase avele ukuze abangele ukubheduka.	Since we can eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear to cause mutations.
736	en	zu	A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.	Izinhlobonhlobo zama-CoV a-zoonotic ziyajikeleza ehlane.	A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wilderness.
737	en	zu	Particularly, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse.	Ngokukhethekile, ama-CoV elulwane anamandla e-zoonotic ahlukahlukene kakhulu.	Specifically, coV in the nest has very different zoonotic strengths.
738	en	zu	There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future.	Kukhona amathuba amaningi okuthi lawa ma-CoV e-zoonotic ashintshe futhi ahlangane kabusha, okuzophumela kuma-CoV amasha akwazi ukuthelelana kakhulu kanye/noma abulale abantu esikhathini esizayo.	There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will change and regroup, resulting in new CoVs being more likely to interact and/or kill people in the future.
739	en	zu	The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.	Isiko lokudla izilwane zasendle kwezinye izindawo zase-China kufanele liyekwe ukuze kuncishiswe ukuxhumana okungadingekile phakathi kwabantu nezilwane.	The tradition of eating wildlife in some parts of China should be stopped in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
740	en	zu	With the ordeals of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.	Ngezigameko ze-SARS, i-MERS kanye ne-COVID-19, kufanele kube khona uhlelo lokulungela nokusabela olungcono kakhulu.	In cases of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a much better readiness and response system.
741	en	zu	In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time.	Empeleni, amagciwane amaningi anesikhathi eside ekhona emhlabeni.	In fact, many viruses have long existed on earth.
742	en	zu	They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.	Ahlala ezindaweni zawo ezingokwemvelo kuze kube yilapho ethola ithuba lokuphuma.	They stay in their natural habitats until they have a chance to get out.
743	en	zu	Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.	Nakuba amalulwane enezici eziningi ezikhuthaza ukusakazwa kwamagciwane, ithuba lokuthi abantu baxhumane namalulwane nezinye izilwane zasendle angacishiswa uma abantu befundiswa ukuthi baqhele kuzona.	Although bats have many characteristics that promote the spread of viruses, the opportunity for humans to communicate with bats and other wildlife can be turned off if people are taught they are used to them.
744	en	zu	Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.	Ukugadwa okuqhubekayo kwezilwane ezincelisayo kuyadingeka ukuze kuqondwe kangcono i-ecology yama-CoV nababungazi bawo abangokwemvelo, okuzoba usizo ekuvimbeni ukutheleleka okusuka ezilwaneni kuye kubantu kanye nokubheduka kwesikhathi esizayo.	Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be helpful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future mutations.
745	en	zu	To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.	Uma sesiphetha, indlela engcono kakhulu yokuvimba i-zoonosis yamagciwane iwukuba abantu baqhele endaweni ezungezile eyimithombo engokwemvelo yamagciwane a-zoonotic.	When we end up, the best way to prevent bacterial zoonosis is to get people used to the environment which is a natural source of zoonotic bacteria.
746	en	zu	Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.	Izingxenye ezimbalwa ze-puzzle yomsuka we-zoonotic ye-SARS-CoV-2 azikatholakali.	A few parts of the zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
747	en	zu	First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.	Okokuqala, uma amalulwane edlulisa igciwane eliwukhokho we-SARS-CoV-2 kuma-pangolin, kuzozuzisa ukubona ukuthi kungaphansi kwaziphi izimo amalulwane nama-pangolin engakwazi ukwabelana ngokufana kwendawo ezungezile.	First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be beneficial to see under what conditions bats and pangolins cannot share the similarities of the environment.
748	en	zu	Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.	Okwesibili, uma amalulwane edlala indima eqonde kakhulu ekuthelelekeni kwabantu, kufanele kutholwe ukuthi abantu baxhumana kanjani namalulwane.	Secondly, if bats play a very direct role in human contact, it should be found out how humans interact with bats.
749	en	zu	Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.	Okwesithathu, uma isilwane esincelisayo sisebenza njengombungazi wangempela omaphakathi, indlela esisebenzelana ngayo nezidalwa ezihlukahlukene okuhlanganisa abantu, amalulwane nama-pangolin kufanele icaciswe.	Third, if a mammal acts as a real intermediate host, how it interacts with a variety of creatures that include humans, bats and pangolins should be explained.
750	en	zu	Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.	Okokugcina, njengoba izilwane eziningi ezincelisayo kuhlanganise nezilwane ezifuywayo zingase zichayeke ku-SARS-CoV-2, kokubili ukugadwa nokutheleleka kokucwaninga kufanele kwenziwe.	Finally, as many mammals including pets may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and research involvement should be made.
751	en	zu	Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future.	Uma kungase kube ilulwane, i-pangolin noma esinye isilwane esincelisayo, kulindelwe ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 noma amagciwane ayo angumzali acishe afane azotholwa kumbungazi wawo ongokwemvelo esikhathini esizayo.	If it may be a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses will almost certainly be found in their natural host in the future.
752	en	zu	Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.	Ukucwaningwa okuqhubekayo kule ndawo kuzochaza umzila wokuziphendukela kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ezilwaneni, nemiphumela ebalulekile ekuvinjweni naskulawulweni kwe-COVID-19 kubantu.	Ongoing research in this area will explain the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 mutation in animals, and the important effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
753	en	zu	Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “suspected case” and “confirmed case” is necessary	Ukubuyekezwa kombandela wokuxilongwa kwalabo “abasolwa” futhi “abaqinisekisiwe” ukuthi baphethwe i-COVID-19 kuyadinga	"A review of the diagnosis of those who are ""suspected"" and ""confirmed"" to be infected with COVID-19 is needed"

909	en	zu	Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.	Eminye imininingwane yendlela isifo esisabalala ngayo isadingidwa kwayimanje.	More details of how the disease is spreading are still needed right now.
910	en	zu	The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).	Isifo sikholelwa ukuthi sisabalala ngokuyinhloko phakathi nokuthintana okuseduze nangamaconsi amancane akheka lapho ukhwehlela, uthimula, noma ukhuluma; lapho othintana eduze engaba kumitha elingu-1 kuye ku-2 (u-3 kuye ku-6 amagxathi).	The disease is believed to spread primarily between close contact and small droplets formed when coughing, sneezing, or talking; where the closest contact is between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
911	en	zu	Studies have found that an uncovered coughing can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).	Ucwaningo luthole ukuthi ukukhwehlela okungamboziwe kungaholela amaconsi ukuthi ahambe ibanga elingafika kumamitha angu-4.5 (15 amagxathi) kuye kumamitha angu-8.2 metres (27 amagxathi).	Research has found that uncovered coughs can lead droplets to travel a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
912	en	zu	Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that stay for more prolonged periods in the air, that may be generated during speech.Respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing out, including when talking, though the virus is not generally airborne.	Abanye baphakamise ukuthi igciwane lingase lidluliselwe ngamaconsi amancane ahlala isikhathi esijana emoyeni, angaba khona phakathi nokukhuluma. Amaconsana okuphefumula nawo angase akheke phakathi nokukhipha umoya wokuphefumula, kuhlanganise nalapho ukhuluma, yize ngokuvamile igciwane lingahambi ngomoya.	Others have suggested that the virus may be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air, which may be present during speech. Respiratory droplets can also be formed during breathing, including when talking, although the virus is usually not airborne.
913	en	zu	The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.	Amaconsi angahlala emilomeni noma emakhaleni abantu abaseduze noma kwenzeke ahogelwe angene emaphashini.	Droplets can stay on the noses or noses of people nearby or be moved into the lungs.
914	en	zu	Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolized and thus result in airborne spread.	Ezinye izinqubo zokwelapha njenge-intubation ne-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) angase abangele ukuchicha kokuphefumula ukuba kufutheke bese umphumela ube ukusaphazeka ngomoya.	Other treatment procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory respiration to swell and the effect becomes airborne.
915	en	zu	It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.	Ingase isabalale futhi lapho othile ethinta indawo enegciwane, okuhlanganisa isikhumba, bese ezithinta amehlo, ikhala, noma umlomo.	It may also spread when someone touches an infected area, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
916	en	zu	While there are concerns it may spread by faeces, this risk is believed to be low.	Noma kukhona ukukhathazeka ukuthi ingase yande ngothuvi, ingozi ikholelwa ukuthi iphansi.	Although there are concerns that it may increase with worms, the risk is believed to be low.
917	en	zu	The Government of China denied the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.	Uhulumeni wase-China uliphikile ithuba lokwenzeka kokuthatheleka kwegciwane le-SARS-CoV-2 ngokuthinta umlomo ngemva kokuthintana nendle. Igciwane linengozi yokuthelelana kakhulu phakathi nezinsuku ezintathu zokuqala nje lapho kuvela izimpawu yize ukusabalala kungenzeka ngaphambi kokuvela kwezimpawu futhi nasezigabeni zokugcina zesifo.	The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by touching the mouth after contact with the wild. The virus has a high risk of transmission within the first three days of symptoms although spread can occur before symptoms appear and in the final stages of the disease.
918	en	zu	People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before onset of symptoms suggesting transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.	Abantu bahlolwe batholakala benalo igciwane izinsuku ezifika kwezintathu ngaphambi kokuvela kwezimpawu okubonisa ukuthi ukudlulisela kungenzeka ngaphambi kokwakheka kwezimpawu ezimqoka.	People tested positive for the virus up to three days before symptoms appeared indicating transmission was possible before the formation of key symptoms.
919	en	zu	Only few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.	Imibiko embalwa kuphela yezibonelo ezingenazo izimpawu eziqinisekiswe elebhu ebonisayo, kodwa ukudluliselana ngaphandle kwezimpawu kuye kwakhonjwa amanye amazwe phakathi nophenyo lokulandelela ukuthintana.	Only a few reports of asymptomatic examples were confirmed in the lab showing up, but unsymptomatic transmissions have been pointed to other countries during contact tracing investigations.
920	en	zu	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.	I-European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ibeka ukuthi yize ingacaci kahle indlela isifo esisabalala kalula ngayo, umuntu oyedwa ngokuvamile uthelela abanye ababili noma abathathu. Igciwane liqhubeka liphila amahora kuya ezinsukwini ngaphezulu kwezinto.

1415	en	zu	Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.	Ukususa ama-microorganism esikhumbeni kuba nakangcono ngokufakwa kwensipho noma okokuhlanza emanzini.	Removing microorganisms from the skin is even better with soap or water purifier.
1416	en	zu	The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.	Umsebenzi oyinhloko wensipho nokokuhlanza ukunciphisa izinto ezivimba isixazululo, futhi zikhuphule i-solubility.	The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the substances that block the solution, and increase solubility.
1417	en	zu	Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water.	Amanzi wodwa awanele ekuhlanzeni isikhumba ngoba amafutha namaphrotheyini, ayizakhiwo zenhlabathi, awancibiliki kalula emanzini.	Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins, which are soil structures, do not melt easily in water.
1418	en	zu	Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water..	Kodwa ukuhlanza kusizwa amanzi agelezayo ngokwezinga..	But vomiting is helped by water flowing at scale..
1419	en	zu	Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses.	Insipho eyiqhuzu, ngoba iyakwazi ukuphinde isebenze, ingase igcine igciwane elisele ekusebenzeni kwangaphambili.	A foul soap, because it is able to re-function, may retain the remaining virus in previous functions.
1420	en	zu	A small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.	Isibalo esincane socwaningo olubheke ukudluliselwa kwegciwane elisuka ensiphweni eyiqhuzu ethole ukungcola siphethe ngokuthi akunakwenzeka njengoba amagciwane ehlambululeka kanye negwebu.	A small number of studies looking at the transmission of a virus from a contaminated virus conclude that it is not possible as viruses are washed away with foam.
1421	en	zu	"The CDC still states ""liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable""."	"I-CDC isaqhubeka nokuthi ""insipho ewuketshezi nokulawula ngaphandle kwezandla kungcono""."	"The CDC continues to say that ""liquid soap and hands-off control are better""."
1422	en	zu	Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.	Izinsipho eziqeda amagciwane zikhangiswe kakhulu amalungu omphakathi okhathalela ezempilo.	Disinfectant soaps are widely advertised by members of the health care community.
1423	en	zu	To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.	Kuze kube namuhla, abukho ubufakazi bokuthi ukusebenzisa ama-antiseptics noma ama-disinfectants asikiselwayo kukhetha ama-antibiotic-resistant organisms emvelo.	To date, there is no evidence that using antiseptics or recommended disinfectants is a choice for natural antibiotic-resistant organisms.
1424	en	zu	However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.	Nokho, izinsipho ezi-antibacterial zinezimeleli ezivamile zama-antibacterial njenge-triclosan, enohlu elude lwama-resistant strains ama-organism.	However, antibacterial soaps have common antibacterial properties such as triclosan, which has a long range of resistant strains of organisms.
1425	en	zu	So, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.	Ngakho, ngisho noma ama-antibiotic resistant strains engakhethiwe insipho e-antibacterial, kungenzeka ingakwazi ukusebenza kahle ngendlela edayiselwa yona.	Thus, even though antibiotic resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soap, they may not be able to work as well as they are sold.
1426	en	zu	Besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.	Ngaphandle kwalokho i-surfactant nesimeleli esivikela isikhumba, izakhiwo eziyinkimbinkimbi zingase zibe nama-acid (i-acetic acid, i-ascorbic acid, i-lactic acid) njengesilawuli se-pH, i-antimicrobially active benzoic acid nezinye izinakekeli zesikhumba (i-aloe vera, ama-vitamin, i-menthol, ama-plant extracts). Ukuhlolisisa okubanzi okuvela e-University of Oregon School of Public Health kwabonisa ukuthi izinsipho ezingenalutho zisebenza ngempumelelo ngendlela efanayo nama-consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps ane-triclosan ekuvikeleni ukugula nokususa amagciwane ezadleni.	Besides surfactant and a protective agent for the skin, complex structures may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin care products (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). Extensive studies from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that empty soaps work as effectively as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps with triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from food.
1427	en	zu	Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.	Amanzi ashisayo ongakwazi ukuhlanza ngawo izandla awashisi ngezinga elifanele ukuze kufe amagciwane.	Hot water with which you can clean your hands does not wash at the right rate to prevent germs from dying.
1428	en	zu	Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).	Amagciwane akhula kakhulu lapho ukushisa komziba kungu-(37 °C).	Viruses grow most when the temperature of the patch is (37 °C).
1429	en	zu	However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria.	Kodwa, amanzi afudumele, anensipho asebenza kangcono kunamanzi abandayo, anensipho ekususeni amafutha emvelo abamba inhlabathi namagciwane.	But, warm, soapy water works better than cold, soapy water in removing natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
1430	en	zu	Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.	Ngokuhlukile kokukholelwa inqwaba kodwa, ucwaningo lososayensi lubonisile ukuthi ukusebenzisa amanzi afudumele akunamthelela ekunciphiseni i-microbial load ezandleni.	Ignored by many beliefs yet, scientific research has shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on hands.
1431	en	zu	A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.	I-hand sanitizer noma i-hand antiseptic iyisimeleli senhlanzeko yezandla esingenziwe ngamanzi.	Hand sanitizer or antiseptic hand is a representative of water-free hand hygiene.
1432	en	zu	In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.	Ekupheleni kwawo-1990 nasekuqaleni kwengxenye lekhulu yekhulu leminyaka lama-21, izimeleli zenhlanzeko yezandla ezingenziwe ngamanzi zokuhlikihla nge-alcohol (zibuye zaziwe ngokuthi ama-alcohol-based hand rubs, ama-antiseptic hand rubs, noma ama-hand sanitizers) aqala ukuthola ukuduma.	In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
1433	en	zu	Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.	Amaningi asekelwe ku-isopropyl alcohol noma i-ethanol eyakhuwe yahlanganiswa ngesimeleli esishubisayo njenge-Carbomer (i-polymer of acrylic acid) yenze kube ijeli, noma i-humectant njenge-glycerin ibe uketshezi, noma igwebu ukuze kube lula ukusebenzisa nokunciphisa isimo sokoma se-alcohol.	Many based on isopropyl alcohol or diluted ethanol were mixed with a moist solvent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) made into gel, or humectant as glycerin into liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduction of alcohol drying status.
1434	en	zu	Adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further  the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.	Ukufaka i-hydrogen-peroxide efakwe uketshezi iphakamisa umsebenzi we-antimicrobial nakakhulu. Ama-hand sanitizer ane-alcohol engu-60 to 95% abulala amagciwane ngempumelelo.	The inclusion of hydrogen-peroxide in liquids raises antimicrobial activity even more. Hand sanitizers with alcohol of 60 to 95% effectively kill bacteria.
1435	en	zu	Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.	Ama-alcohol rub sanitizer abulala amagciwane, ama-multi-drug resistant bacteria (i-MRSA ne-VRE), i-tuberculosis, namanye amagciwane (kuhlanganise i-HIV, ama-herpe, i-RSV, i-rhinovirus, i-vaccinia, i-influenza, ne-hepatitis) ne-fungi.	Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
1436	en	zu	Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.	Ama-alcohol rub sanitizers ane-70% ye-alcohol abulala u-99.97% (u-3.5 log ngokuncipha, ngokufanayo no-35 decibel ngokuncipha) wamagciwane ezandleni ngemizuzwana engu-30 ngemuva kokugcoba no-99.99% kuye ku-99.999% (4 kuya ku-5 log ngokuncipha) kwamagciwane ezandleni umzuzu ongu-1 ngemuva kokugcoba. Ama-hand sanitizers asebenza kahle kumagciwane futhi asebenze kancane kumagciwane athile.	Alcohol rub sanitizers with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log by shrinking, similar to 35 decibel by shrink) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after rubbing and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log by shrink) of bacteria in hands 1 minute after rubbing. Hand sanitizers work well against bacteria and are less effective against certain viruses.
1437	en	zu	Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.	Ama-hand sanitizer enziwe nge-alcohol acishe angasebenzi nhlobo ku-norovirus (noma i-Norwalk) uhlobo lwamagciwane, imbangela eyinhloko ye-gastroenteritis ethelelanayo. I-hand antiseptic eyanele noma i-alcohol rub kumele isebenziswe ukuthi ithambise ngokuphelele noma imboze zombili izandla.	Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective in the norovirus (or Norwalk) type of virus, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. An adequate antiseptic hand or alcohol rub should be used to fully lubricate or cover both hands.
1438	en	zu	The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.	Ingaphambili nengemuva lazo zombili izandla nangaphakathi nasekugcineni kweminwe kuyahlikihlwa cishe imizuzwana engu-30 kuze kube yilapho uketshezi, igwebu noma ijeli isiyomile.	The front and back of both hands and inside and at the end of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
1439	en	zu	Finger tips must be washed well too, rubbing them in both palms.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty.	Izingcina zeminwe kumele zihlanzwe nazo, zihlikihlwe ezintendeni zombili. I-The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention ikhuthaza ukuhlanza izandla kunokuhlikihla ngama-hand sanitizer, ikhakhulukazi lapho kusobala ukuthi izandla zingclolile.	Fingertips should also be cleaned, rubbed in both tents. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than rubbing them with hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are apparently scratched.
1440	en	zu	The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.	Ukuphakama ekusebenziseni lezi zimeleli kungenxa yokusenza kwazo okulula namandla okushesha ukubulala ama-micro-organisms; kodwa, okufanele zisetshenziswe ukuze zithathe indawo yokuhlanza izandla efanele ngaphandle kwalapho insipho namanzi kungatholakali.	The height in the use of these representatives is due to their simple and fast-acting ability to kill micro-organisms; but, which should be used to replace proper hand sanitizer unless soap and water is not available.
1441	en	zu	Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.	Ukusebenzisa ama-hand sanitizer asekelwe ku-alcohol njalo kungabangela isikhumba esomile ngaphandle kwalapho uma kufakwe ama-emollient kanye/noma iziswakamisi zesikhumba ekuhlanganiseni.	Using alcohol-based hand sanitizers regularly can cause dry skin out there when emollients and/or skin rashes are added to the mixing.
1442	en	zu	The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.	Inqubo yokoma kwe-alcohol ingancishiswa noma kuqedwe ngokufaka i-glycerin kanye/noma ama-emollients ekuhlanganiseni.	The process of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by incorporating glycerin and/or emollients into the mixing.
1443	en	zu	In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.	Ekuhloleni kokwelapha, ama-hand sanitizers asekelwe ku-alcohol anama-emollients enza ukulunyelwa kwesikhumba okwehle kakhulu nokoma kunensipho noma izihlanzi ezine-antimicrobial.	In therapeutic tests, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients make for a much lower and drer skin rash than soap or antimicrobial fish.
1444	en	zu	Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.	I-Allergic contact dermatitis, i-contact urticaria syndrome noma i- hypersensitivity to alcohol noma ama-additives akhona kuma-alcohol hand rubs awavamile ukuba khona.	Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
1445	en	zu	The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.	Isimo esiphansi sokubangela i-irritant contact dermatitis sibe okukhangayo uma siqhathaniswa nokuhlanza izandla ngensipho namanzi.	The low condition of causing irritant contact dermatitis is attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
1446	en	zu	Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them.	Kungakhathaliseki ukusebenza kwazo, izimeleli ezingenamanzi azikwazi ukuhlanza izandla ezintweni zemvelo, kodwa zibulala amagciwane nje.	Regardless of their effectiveness, waterproof agents cannot clean hands from natural substances, but they simply kill bacteria.
1447	en	zu	It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.	Kungalesi sizathu ukuthi ama-hand sanitizers awasebenzi kahle njengensipho namanzi ekuvikeleni ukusabalala kwama-pathogens amaningi, njengoba ama-pathogens eqhubeka esezandleni.	For this reason hand sanitizers do not work as well as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens continue to be on hand.
1448	en	zu	Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs.	Ukuphumelela kwama-hand sanitizer angenayo i-alcohol kuncike kakhulu ezithakweni nokuhlanganiswa, futhi ngokomlando asebenza ngokuphoxayo kune-alcohol nama-alcohol rubs.	The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on ingredients and combinations, and historically works more disappointingly than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
1449	en	zu	More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.	Muva nje, ukuhlanganisa okusebenzisa i-benzalkonium chloride kubonise ukuphikelela nokwanda komsebenzi we-antimicrobial ngemuva kokugcoba, ngokungafani ne-alcohol, esibonisiwe ukuthi yehlisa izinga lokusebenza ngemva kokusebenza ngokuphindwa, kungenzeka ingesizathu sokusabela okuqhubekayo kwesikhumba.	Recently, combinations using benzalkonium chloride have shown persistence and increased antimicrobial activity after lubrication, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lower the performance rate after repeated performance, may not be the reason for the skin's continued reaction.
1450	en	zu	Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.	Abantu abaningi emiphakathini entulayo kwezezimali abakwazi ukuthenga insipho futhi basebenzisa umlotha noma inhlabathi esikhundleni.	Many people in financially deprived communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
1451	en	zu	Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.	Umlotha noma inhlabathi ingase isebenze kangcono kunamanzi kuphela, kodwa isebenze kancane kunensipho.	Ash or soil may only work better than water, but it works less than soap.
1452	en	zu	One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.	Okukodwa okukhathazayo ukuthi uma inhlabathi noma umlotha uthole ukungcola kwama-micro-organisms kungase kuphakamise ukusabalala kwesifo kunokusinciphisa.	One concern is that if soil or ash gets micro-organism contamination it may raise the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
1453	en	zu	Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.	Njengensipho, umlotha nawo uyisimeleli esiqeda igciwane ngoba lapho uhlanganiswa namanzi, kudaleka ingxube ye-alkaline.	Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because when combined with water, an alkaline mixture is created.
1454	en	zu	WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.	I-WHO ikhuthaza umlotha noma isihlabathi esikhundleni sensipho uma insipho ingatholakali.	WHO recommends ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
1455	en	zu	Correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control  for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:	Inqubo efanele yokuhlanza izandla ekhuthazwa i-US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of transmission of disease ihlanganisa lezi zinyathelo:	The proper hand hygiene procedure recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:

1457	en	zu	Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.	Amanzi ahambayo ayakhuthazwa ngoba obheseni abamile kungenzeka babe nokungcola, kanti isimo sokubanda noma sokushisa samanzi asibonisi senza umehluko.	Running water is recommended because dry beers are likely to be contaminated, and the cold or hot conditions of the water do not make a difference.
1458	en	zu	Lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails.	Gcoba izandla ngokuzihlikihla ngensipho eyanele kahle, kuhlanganise ingemuva lezandla, phakathi neminwe, nangaphansi kwezinzipho.	Rub your hands with a properly sufficient soap, including the back of the hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
1459	en	zu	Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone.	Insipho iphakamisa amagciwane esikhumbeni, futhi ucwaningo lubonisa ukuthi abantu bavame ukuhlanza izandla zabo kakhle uma insipho ikhona kunalapho besebenzisa amanzi kuphela.	Soap raises bacteria in the skin, and studies show that people tend to clean their hands better when soap is present than when using only water.
1460	en	zu	Scrub for at least 20 seconds.	Huhla okungenani imizuzwana engu-20.	Drag for at least 20 seconds.
1461	en	zu	Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.	Ukuhuhla kubangela ukushisa, okusizayo ekususeni amagciwane esikhumbeni, futhi ukuhuhla isikhathi esinde kususa amagciwane engeziwe.	Diarrhea causes heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and prolonged diarrhea removes additional bacteria.
1462	en	zu	Rinse well under running water.	Hlambulula kahle ngaphansi kwamanzi ahambayo.	Clean well under running water.

1875	en	zu	More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.	Abantu abangaphezu kuka-568,000 baye balulama. Leli gciwane ngokuyinhloko lisakazeka phakathi kwabantu abathintanayo, ngokuvamile ngamaconsi amancanyana aphuma lapho ukhwehlela, uthimula, noma ukhuluma.	More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus primarily spreads among people in contact, usually with small droplets coming out when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
1876	en	zu	While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.	Nakuba la maconsi ephuma lapho uphefumula, ngokuvamile awela phansi noma ezintweni kunokuba abe amagciwane emabangeni amade.	Although these droplets come out of the breath, they often fall down or into objects rather than become bacteria at long distances.
1877	en	zu	People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.	Abantu bangase bangenwe igciwane nangokuthinta indawo enegciwane bese bezithinta amehlo, ikhala, noma umlomo.	People may become infected by touching an infected area and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
1878	en	zu	The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.	Leli gciwane lingaphila ezintweni amahora angaba ngu-72.	The virus can live on objects for up to 72 hours.
1879	en	zu	It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.	Lithathelana kakhulu phakathi nezinsuku ezintathu zokuqala ngemva kokuqala kwezimpawu zesifo, nakuba lingabhebhetheka ngaphambi kokuvela kwezimpawu zesifo nasezigabeni zakamuva zegciwane. Indlela evamile yokuxilonga yi-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) ngeswabhu yamankanka.	It is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it can develop before symptoms appear and in recent stages of the virus. The most common method of diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with a laboratory.
1880	en	zu	The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.	Ukusetshenziswa kwamamaski kuyakhuthazwa kulabo abasola ukuthi banegciwane nabanakekeli babo.	The use of masks is encouraged for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
1881	en	zu	Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.	Ukusikisela kokuba umphakathi wonkana usebenzise imaski kuyahluka, ezinye iziphathimandla zithi awangasetshenziswa, ezinye zithi awasetshenziswe, kanti ezinye ziyaphoqa ukuba asetshenziswe.	Suggestions that communities everywhere use masks vary, with some authorities saying they cannot be used, others saying they are not, and others forcing them to use them.
1882	en	zu	Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.	Njengamanje, awukho umgomo noma ukwelashwa okuqondile okulwa negciwane le-COVID-19.	Currently, there is no specific policy or treatment against the COVID-19 virus.
1883	en	zu	Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.	Ukudluliselwa kwegciwane kuye kwatholakala emazweni amaningi kuzo zonke izindawo eziyisithupha ze-WHO.	Virus transmission has been detected in many countries across six WHO sites.
1884	en	zu	Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.	Labo abangenwa igciwane bangase bangabi nazimpawu zesifo noma babe nezimpawu zesifo ezinjengezomkhuhlane njengemfiva, umkhuhlane, ukukhathala, nephika.	Those who are infected may have no symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, fever, fatigue, and fever.
1885	en	zu	Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.	Izimpawu zesifo zesimo esiphuthumayo zibandakanya ubunzima bokuphefumula, ubuhlungu besifuba obuphikelelayo noma ingcindezi, ukudideka, ubunzima bokuvuka, nobuso nezindebe eziluhlazana; kukhuthazwa ukuthola usizo lukadokotela masinyane uma lezi zimpawu zesifo zibonakala.	Symptoms of an emergency condition include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty waking up, and face and blue lips; it is recommended to get medical help as soon as these symptoms appear.
1886	en	zu	Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.	Okungavamile, izimpawu ezithinta ukuphefumula ngenhla ezifana nokuthimula, amafinyila noma umphimbo obuhlungu zingase zibonakale.	Unusually, symptoms affecting upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sneezing or sore throat may appear.
1887	en	zu	Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.	Izimpawu zesifo emgudwini osuka emlonyeni uya ezinqeni njengesicanucanu, ukuhlanza nohudo ziye zabonakala ngamaphesenti ahlukahlukayo.	Symptoms of the disease in the process from the mouth to the hips such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been characterized by varying percentages.
1888	en	zu	Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.	Ezinye izigameko eChina zaqale zadala kuphela ukuqina kwesifuba nokushaya ngamandla kwenhliziyo.	Some cases in China initially only created chest stiffness and heart rate.
1889	en	zu	In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.	Kwezinye, isifo singadlondlobala sibe yinyumoniya, sibulale izitho eziningi, futhi sibulale.	In some, the disease can develop into pneumonia, kill many organs, and kill it.
1890	en	zu	This is called the incubation period.	Lokhu kubizwa nangokuthi inkathi yokuvela kwezimpawu zesifo.	This is also called the onset of symptoms.
1891	en	zu	The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.	Inkathi yokuvela kwezimpawu zesifo ye-COVID-19 ngokuvamile iba izinsuku ezinhlanu kuya kweziyisithupha kodwa ingasukela ezinsukwini ezimbili kuya kwezingu-14.	The onset period of symptoms of COVID-19 usually lasts five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
1892	en	zu	97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms.	U-97.5% wabantu ababa nezimpawu zesifo uba nazo phakathi nezinsuku ezingu-11.5 bengenwe isifo. Imibiko ibonisa ukuthi akubona bonke abangenwa igciwane ababa nezimpawu zesifo.	97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people develop symptoms.
1893	en	zu	The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.	Indima yalaba abangenazo izimpawu zesifo ekusidluliseleni kwabanye ayikaziwa ngokugcwele; nokho, ubufakazi bamanje busikisela ukuthi bangase babe negalelo ekubhebhethekeni kwegciwane.	The role of these asymptomatic in transmitting it to others is not yet fully known; however, current evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
1894	en	zu	The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.	Isibalo sabantu abangenwa igciwane abangabonisi izimpawu zesifo njengamanje asaziwa futhi sisacwaningwa, futhi i-Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) ibika ukuthi u-20% wabo bonke abangenwe igciwane ubulokhu ungenazimpawu zesifo ngesikhathi ulaliswe esibhedlela.	The number of people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is still being investigated, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have been asymptomatic while hospitalized.
1895	en	zu	China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.	I-National Health Commission yaseChina yaqala ukubandakanya izigameko zabangenazimpawu zesifo ezibalweni zayo zansuku zonke ngomhla ka-1 April; kwabanegciwane abangu-166 ngalolo suku, abangu-130 (78%) babengenazimpawu zesifo lapho behlolwa.	China's National Health Commission began including cases of asymptomatic cases in its daily statistics on 1 April; of the 166 infected that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms when tested.
1896	en	zu	Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.	Kokubili isikhwehlela namathe kungaqukatha igciwane.	Both cough and saliva can contain the virus.
1897	en	zu	Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.	Ukukhulumela phezulu kukhipha amaconsi amaningana kunokukhuluma okuvamile.	Talking up takes out several drops more than normal speech.
1898	en	zu	A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).	Ucwaningo eSingapore luthole ukuthi ukukhwehlela ngaphandle kokumboza kungaholela emaconsini ahamba amamitha angaba ngu-4.5 (amafithi angu-15).	Research in Singapore has found that coughing without a cover can lead to droplets that travel up to 4.5 meters (15 inches).
1899	en	zu	Though the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA.	Nakuba igciwane ngokuvamile lingadluliseleki emoyeni, i-National Academy of Science isikisele ukuthi lingadluliseleka ngokuhogelwa futhi iziqongeleli zomoya ezisemaphaseji ngaphandle kwamagumbi abantu zakhipha amasampula aphozithivu egciwane le-RNA.	Although the virus is usually not transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted through sneering and air containers in corridors outside people's rooms released negative samples of the RNA virus.
1900	en	zu	Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.	Izinqubo ezithile zezokwelapha njengokufakwa kweshubhu ne-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) zingabangela ukukhiqizwa kwezinhlayiya ukuba zikhishelwe emoyeni futhi kuphumele ekubhebhethekeni ngokuhogelwa.	Certain medical procedures such as tube transplantation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the production of particles to be released into the air and result in a sneering.
1901	en	zu	While there are concerns it may spread via feces, this risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while spread may be possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.	Nakuba kunokukhathazeka kokuthi lingabhebhetheka ngendle, lobu bungozi kucatshangwa ukuthi buncane. Igciwane lithelelana kakhulu lapho abantu benezimpawu zesifo; nakuba ukubhebhetheka kungenzeka ngaphambi kokubonakala kwezimpawu zesifo, ubungozi buncane.	Although there are concerns that it may float in the wild, this risk is thought to be minimal. The virus is highly contagious when people have symptoms of the disease; although seizures may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is minimal.
1902	en	zu	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.	I- European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ithi nakuba ingakacaci ngokuphelele indlela okulula ngayo ukuba igciwane libhebhetheke, umuntu oyedwa ngokuvamile uthelela abantu ababili noma abathathu. Igciwane liyaphila amahora kuya ezinsukwini ezintweni.	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet fully clear how easy it is for the virus to spread, one person usually infects two or three people. The virus lives hours to days in things.
1903	en	zu	Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.	Ngokukhethekile, kwatholakala ukuthi igciwane liyaphila usuku olulodwa kukhadibhodi, izinsuku ezingaba zintathu kupulasitiki (i-polypropylene) nasensimbini (i-AISI 304), namahora angaba mane ethusini elingu-99%.	Specifically, it was found that the virus lives for one day on cardboard, about three days in plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304), and about four hours in a 99% concentration.
1904	en	zu	This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.	Nokho, lokhu, kuyahlukahluka kuye ngomswakama nezinga lokushisa.	This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
1905	en	zu	Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, deactivating it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.	Insipho nayo ingasebenza uma isetshenziswe kahle; imikhiqizo yensipho iyalunciphisa ulwelwesi oluvikelayo lwamafutha egciwane, ilubulale, futhi iyalususa esikhunjeni nakwezinye izindawo.	Soap can also work when used properly; Soap products reduce the protective membrane of the virus oil, kill it, and remove it from the skin and elsewhere.
1906	en	zu	Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken a median of two days after the start of hospitalization.	Ezinye izinsipho, njenge-benzalkonium chloride ne-chlorhexidine gluconate (isibulali magciwane sezindawo zokuhlinza), azisebenzi kahle. Ocwaningweni lwaseHong Kong, amasampula amathe athathwa ezinsukwini ezimbili ngemva kokuqala ukulaliswa esibhedlela.	Some soaps, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), do not work properly. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken two days after they were first hospitalized.
1907	en	zu	In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.	Ezigulini ezinhlanu kweziyisithupha, isampula lokuqala labonisa inani legciwane eliphakeme, futhi isiguli sesithupha sabonisa inani legciwane eliphakeme ngosuku lwesibili sihloliwe.	In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a higher infection rate, and the sixth patient showed a higher infection rate on the second day of testing.
1908	en	zu	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.	I-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) iyi-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus embi kakhulu, eqala ngokukhishwa kubantu abathathu abanenyumoniya yaxhumeka ezifweni eziningi ezimbi kakhulu zokuphefumula eWuhan.	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which begins with discharge in three people with pneumonia linked to many of Wuhan's worst respiratory illnesses.
1909	en	zu	All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.	Zonke izici zegciwane le-SARS-CoV-2 elisha zivela kuma-coronavirus.	All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are from coronaviruses.
1910	en	zu	Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.	Lapho lingaphandle komzimba womuntu, igciwane libulawa insipho yasendlini, eqhumisa ibhamuza lalo elivikelayo. I-SARS-CoV-2 ihlobene eduze ne-SARS-CoV.	When outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, burning its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
1911	en	zu	The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.	Amaphaphu ayizitho ezithinteka kakhulu ku-COVID-19 ngoba igciwane lingena kumaseli ayinhloko nge-enzyme okuthiwa yi-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), etholakala ngobuningi ohlotsheni II lwamaseli e-alveolar emaphashini.	The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells through an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in bulk in group II alveolar cells in the lungs.
1912	en	zu	"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell."	"Igciwane lisebenzisa i-glycoprotein ekhethekile ebizwa ngokuthi ""i-spike"" (peplomer) ukuze lixhumane ne-ACE2 futhi lingene kuseli eyinhloko."	"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the main cell."
1913	en	zu	Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted in hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.	Ukulimala okubi kakhulu kwenhliziyo kwatholakala kubantu abangu-12% abanegciwane abalaliswe esibhedlela eWuhan, eChina, futhi kuyenzeka kakhulu ezifweni ezibucayi.	The worst heart injury was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is most likely to occur in critical cases.
1914	en	zu	Rates of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.	Amazinga ezimpawu zesifo ze-cardiovascular aphezulu, abangela ukuvuvukala kwesistimu nokugula kwamasosha omzimba phakathi nokudlondlobala kwesifo, kodwa ukuhlaseleka kwenhliziyo okubucayi kungenzeka nako kuhlobene nama-ACE2 receptors enhliziyweni.	Cardiovascular symptoms levels are high, causing systemic inflammation and immune disorders during the severity of the disease, but critical heart attacks are also likely related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
1915	en	zu	ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.	Ama-ACE2 receptors abonakala kakhulu enhliziyweni futhi ahilelekile ekusebenzeni kwenhliziyo.	ACE2 receptors are highly visible in the heart and are involved in heart function.
1916	en	zu	A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.	Isigameko se-thrombosis (31%) ne-venous thromboembolism (25%) sitholakele ezigulini zase-ICU ezinegciwane le-COVID-19 futhi kungenzeka kuhlobene ne-prognosis ebuthaka. Ukuhlonzwa kwabantu ababulewe yi-COVID-19 kubonise i-diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), nokuvuvukala okune-lymphocyte emaphashini.	The case of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to a weaker prognosis. Diagnosis of COVID-19 victims showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and inflammation with lymphocytes in the lungs.
1917	en	zu	Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.	Nakuba i-SARS-COV-2 ine-tropism yamaseli e-ACE2-expressing epithelial omgudu wokuphefumula, iziguli ezine-COVID-19 ebucayi zinezimpawu zesifo se-systemic hyperinflammation.	Although SARS-COV-2 has the tropism of ACE2-expressing epithelial cells in the respiratory system, patients with critical COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
1918	en	zu	In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.	Ngokukhethekile, ama-pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells abonakale ehambelana nokutholwa kwama-IL-6-secreting monocytes avuvukele nezimbangela zesifo ezimbi ephashini ezigulini ezine-COVID-19.	Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells appear to be associated with the discovery of IL-6-secreting monocytes that have rebelled with the causes of severe disease in the lungs in patients with COVID-19.
1919	en	zu	Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.	Kuye kwabikwa nama-lymphocytic infiltrates lapho kuhlolwa izidumbu.	Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported during autopsy.
1920	en	zu	The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.	I-WHO iye yashicilela amaphrothokholi amaningana okuhlola igciwane.	WHO has published several virus testing protocols.

Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to another, especially in treatment areas where procedures that may produce aerosols are performed, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
1960	en	zu	For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.	Kodokotela abanakekela abantu abane-COVID-19, i-CDC ikhuthaza ukugcinwa komuntu ku-Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) ngaphezu kokusebenzisa izinyathelo ezivamile, ukuvimbela ukuthintana nokuhogela igciwane. I-CDC ichaza iziqondiso zokusetshenziswa kwe-personal protective equipment (PPE) phakathi nomqedazwe.	For doctors caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends in-person quarantine in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using common precautions, preventing contact and infecting the virus. The CDC defines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the completion.
1961	en	zu	The recommended gear is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.When available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are preferred.	Izinto ezidingekayo: igawuni ye-PPE, i-respirator noma imaski yobuso, isivikeli samehlo, namagilavu odokotela. Lapho etholakala, kukhuthazwa ama-respirator (esikhundleni samamaski obuso).	Essentials: a glove of PPE, a respirator or face mask, an eye protector, and doctor's gloves. When available, respirators are recommended (instead of face masks).
1962	en	zu	N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).	Ama-N95 respirators agunyazelwe ukusetshenziswa ezimbonini kodwa i-FDA igunyaze amamaski ukuba asetshenziswe ngaphansi kwe-Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).	N95 respirators are authorized for industrial use but the FDA has authorized masks to be used under Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
1963	en	zu	They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.	Aklanyelwe ukuba avikele ezinhlayiyeni ezisemoyeni njengezintuli kodwa ukuvikelwa ku-ejenti yomzimba ethile akuqinisekisiwe ekusetshenzisweni kwayo.	They are designed to protect against airborne particles as particles but protection from a specific body agent is not guaranteed for its use.
1964	en	zu	When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.	Uma amamaski engatholakali, i-CDC isikisela ukusebenzisa ama-face shields noma, uma ingekho enye indlela, amamaski okuzenzela.	If masks are not available, the CDC suggests using face shields or, if there is no other option, make-up masks.
1965	en	zu	Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.	Izimo eziningi ze-COVID-19 azizimbi kakhulu ukuba zingadinga i-mechanical ventilation noma ezinye izindlela, kodwa ezithile ziyakudinga.	Many COVID-19 conditions are not so bad that they may require mechanical ventilation or other means, but some require it.
1966	en	zu	The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.	Uhlobo lokusekelwa kwendlela yokuphefumula lwabantu abanenkinga yokuphefumula ehlobene ne-COVID-19 lusacwaningelwa abantu abasesibhedlela, futhi kunobufakazi obuthile bokuthi i-intubation ingagwenywa ne-high flow nasal cannula noma i-bi-level positive airway pressure.	The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory problems is still being investigated by people in hospital, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
1967	en	zu	Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.	Ukuthi lokhu okubili kuholela enzuzweni efanayo yini kubantu abagula kakhulu akwaziwa.	Whether these two lead to the same benefit to seriously ill people is unknown.
1968	en	zu	Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).	Abanye odokotela bancamela ukuhlala ne-invasive mechanical ventilation uma itholakala ngoba le ndlela inciphisa ukusakazeka kwezinhlayiya ezihogelwayo uma iqhathaniswa ne-high flow nasal cannula. Izimo ezimbi kakhulu zivamile kubantu abadala (abangaphezu kweminyaka engu-60, ikakhulu abangaphezu kweminyaka engu-80).	Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this method reduces the spread of infected particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Extreme conditions are common in adults (over 60, mainly over 80).
1969	en	zu	Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.	Amazwe amaningi asathuthuka awanayo imibhede eyanele yasezibhedlela, okunciphisa inani labantu abangelashwa okubangela ukwehluleka ukusingatha ukwenyuka ngokungalindelekile kwenani labantu abane-COVID-19 ebucayi edinga ukulaliswa esibhedlela.	Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduces the number of people being treated resulting in a failure to handle an unexpected increase in the number of critical COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
1970	en	zu	One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.	Olunye ucwaningo eChina lwathola abangu-5% befakwe endaweni yababangwa nezibi, abangu-2.3% bedinga ukusizwa nge-ventilation, kanti abangu-1.4% bafa.	One study in China found 5% were replaced by the alleged and the bad, 2.3% needed ventilation assistance, and 1.4% died.
1971	en	zu	In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.	EChina, cishe u-30% wabantu esibhedlela abane-COVID-19 bagcina befakwe ku-ICU.	In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are kept in ICU.
1972	en	zu	Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.	Imishini ye-ventilation iba inkimbinkimbi kakhudlwana njengoba i-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) yakheka ku-COVID-19 futhi ukuphefumula kuya ngokuya kuba nzima.

Pregnant women may be at greater risk of the critical COVID-19 virus based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is telling. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
1998	en	zu	In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.	Kulabo abathinteke kakhulu, i-COVID-19 ingadlondlobala masinyane ibe yi-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ibangele umonakalo emgudwini wokuphefumula, i-septic shock noma ibulale izitho eziningi.	For those most affected, COVID-19 can quickly escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing damage to the respiratory system, septic shock or killing multiple organs.
1999	en	zu	Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.	Izinkinga ezihlobene ne-COVID-19 zihlanganisa i-sepsis, i-abnormal clotting nokulimala kwenhliziyo, izinso nesibindi.	COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, abnormal clotting and heart, kidney and liver injuries.
2000	en	zu	Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.	Ama-clotting abnormalities, ngokukhethekile ukwanda kwesikhathi se-prothrombin, atholakale ku-6% walabo abalaliswa esibhedlela ngenxa ye-COVID-19, kuyilapho ukungasebenzi kahle kwezinso kubonakala ku-4% waleli qembu.	Clotting abnormalities, particularly an increase in prothrombin duration, were found in 6% of those hospitalized for COVID-19, while kidney dysfunction appears in 4% of this group.
2001	en	zu	Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID-19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).	Cishe u-20-30% wabantu abane-COVID-19 ubonisa ama-enzyme esibindi aphakeme (transaminases).	Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show high liver enzymes (transaminases).
2002	en	zu	According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five being spent hospitalised.	Ngokombiko ofanayo, isilinganiso sesikhathi phakathi kokuqala kwezimpawu zesifo nokufa yizinsuku eziyishumi, kanti ezinhlanu zichithwa esibhedlela.	According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, and five are spent in hospital.
2003	en	zu	However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.	Nokho, iziguli ezidluliselwa e-ICU zibe nezinsuku ezingaba yisikhombisa phakathi kokulaliswa esibhedlela nokufa.	However, patients transferred to the ICU had about seven days between hospitalization and death.
2004	en	zu	In a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.	Ocwaningweni lwezigameko zokuqala, isilinganiso sesikhathi kusukela ekubonakaleni kwezimpawu zokuqala zesifo kuya ekufeni kwakuyizinsuku ezingu-14, okuyingqikithi yezinsuku eziyisithupha kuya kwezingu-41.	In the study of early cases, the average time from the onset of early symptoms of the disease to death was 14 days, which is a total of six to 41 days.
2005	en	zu	In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.	Ocwaningweni lwe-National Health Commission (NHC) eChina, isilinganiso sabesilisa abafayo singu-2.8% kuyilapho isilinganiso sabesifazane abafayo singu-1.7%.	In a National Health Commission (NHC) study in China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% while the mortality rate for women is 1.7%.
2006	en	zu	Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.	Ama-histopathological examinations amasampula okuhlolwa kwamaphaphu ezidumbu abonisa i-diffuse alveolar damage ne-cellular fibromyxoid exudates kuwo womabili amaphaphu.	Histopathological examinations are samples of autopsies that show diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
2007	en	zu	Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.	Ushintsho lwe-viral cytopathic lwabonakala kuma-pneumocytes.	Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
2008	en	zu	The lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	Isithombe sephaphu sabonisa i-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	The lung image showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2009	en	zu	In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.	Ku-11.8% wabantu abafayo ababikwa yi-National Health Commission eChina, ukulimala kwenhliziyo kwaphawulwa emazingeni aphakeme e-troponin noma ukuma kwenhliziyo.	Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart injuries were characterized by high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
2010	en	zu	According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.	Ngokwedatha yango-March evela e-United States, abangu-89% kulabo abalaliswa esibhedlela babenezifo kakade. Ukutholakala kwezinto zokwelapha nezici ezithinta umnotho nomphakathi zesifunda kungaba negalelo ekufeni kwabantu.	According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized already had infections. The availability of medical supplies and factors affecting the region's economy and society can contribute to deaths.
2011	en	zu	Estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.	Izilinganiso zokufa kwabantu ngenxa yegciwane ziyahlukahluka ngenxa yalowo mehluko ezifundeni, kodwa nangenxa yobunzima ezindleleni ezisetshenziswayo.	The mortality rates for the virus vary due to that difference in regions, but also due to difficulties in the methods used.
2012	en	zu	The under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.	Ukuba mbalwa kwezimo ezingezimbi kakhulu kungabangela isilinganiso sabafayo sibe ngaphezu kokulindelekile.	A few of the worst cases could cause the death toll to be higher than expected.
2013	en	zu	However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.	Nokho, iqiniso lokuthi ukufa kungumphumela wezigameko zabathole igciwane ngokwedlule lingasho ukuthi isilinganiso sabantu abafayo manje siphansi.	However, the fact that death is the result of previous cases of infection may mean that the mortality rate is now low.
2014	en	zu	Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.	Abantu ababhemayo banamathuba aphindeke izikhathi ezingu-1.4 okuthola izimpawu zesifo ezibucayi ze-COVID-19 futhi amathuba aphindeke izikhathi ezingaba ngu-2.4 okuthola ukunakekelwa kwesimo esibucayi noma ukufa uma beqhathaniswa nabantu abangabhemi. Kuye kwavezwa ukukhathazeka ngezifo zesikhathi eside zangaphambi kwegciwane.	People who smoke are 1.4 times more likely to develop symptoms of severe COVID-19 and a 2.4 times more likely to experience critical condition care or death compared to people who do not smoke. Concerns have been expressed about long-term pre-virus diseases.
2015	en	zu	The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.	I-Hong Kong Hospital Authority ithole ukwehla ngo-20% kuya ku-30% ekusebenzeni kwamaphaphu kwabanye abantu abaluleme egciwaneni, namaskeni ephaphu abonisa ukuthi kungenzeka lilimele.	The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has experienced a 20% to 30% drop in lung function in some people who have been infected with the virus, with lung scans suggesting it may be damaged.
2016	en	zu	This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.	Lokhu kungaholela nasegciwaneni langemva kokunakekelwa okubucayi ngemva kokululama.	This can also lead to post-traumatic stress management.
2017	en	zu	As of March 2020, it was unknown if past infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.	Ngo-March 2020, kwakungaziwa ukuthi igciwane elidlule lingasiza ekuvikelekeni okusebenzayo nokwesikhathi eside kubantu abalulamayo egciwaneni.	In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could help effective and long-term protection against people who are prone to the virus.
2018	en	zu	Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases in which recovery from COVID-19 have been followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.	Ukuvikeleka egciwaneni kubonakala kungenzeka, ngokusekelwe kwamanye ama-coronavirus, kodwa kuye kwabikwa izimo lapho ukululama ku-COVID-19 kuye kwalandelwa khona ukuhlolwa okuphozithivu kwe-coronavirus kamuva.	Protection from the virus appears to be possible, based on other coronaviruses, but it has been reported that conditions where a recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive coronavirus test later.
2019	en	zu	These cases are believed to be worsening of a lingering infection rather than re-infection.	Lezi zimo kucatshangwa ukuthi ziwukudlondlobala kwegciwane hhayi ukungenwa igciwane kabusha.	These conditions are thought to be viral infections and not re-infections.
2020	en	zu	The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin, through spillover infection.	Kucatshangwa ukuthi igciwane lingokwemvelo futhi livela esilwaneni, labe selingena kubantu.	The virus is thought to be natural and from an animal, and has entered humans.
2021	en	zu	The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.	Umsuka okuyiwonawona awaziwa, kodwa ngo-December 2019 ukubhebhetheka kwegciwane cishe kwakuholwa ngokuphelele ukudluliselwa kwalo livela kumuntu liya komunye.	The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely driven by its transmission from person to person.
2022	en	zu	A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.	Ucwaningo lwezigameko zokuqala ezingu-41 eziqinisekisiwe ze-COVID-19, olwashicilelwa ngo-January 2020 eLancet, lwabonisa ukuthi usuku lokuqala lokuqubuka kwezimpawu zesifo umhla ka-1 December 2019.

2023	en	zu	Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.	Izincwadi ezisemthethweni ze-WHO zabika ukuthi izimpawu zesifo zokuqala ngqa zaba khona ngomhla ka-8 December 2019.	Official WHO documents reported that the first symptoms of the disease ever occurred on 8 December 2019.
2024	en	zu	Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.	Kusetshenziswa kabanzi izindlela eziningana zokubala abantu abafayo.	Several methods of counting deaths are widely used.
2025	en	zu	These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.	Lezi zinombolo ziyahlukahluka kuye ngesifunda nangokuhamba kwesikhathi futhi zixhomeke ezingeni lokuhlola, ikhwalithi yesistimu yezokwelapha, izindlela zokwelapha, isikhathi kusukela ekuqubukeni kokuqala nezici zabantu njengeminyaka yobudala, ubulili nempilo.	These numbers vary from region to region and over time and depend on the level of testing, quality of medical system, treatment methods, time from early onset and human factors such as age, sex and health.
2026	en	zu	In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.	Ngasekupheleni kuka-2019, i-WHO yabela amakhodi egciwane ezimo eziphuthumayo e-ICD-10, i-U07.1 eyababulewe yigciwane le-SARS-CoV-2 eliqinisekiwe elebhu kanti i-U07.2 eyababulewe yi-COVID-19 ehlonzwe abezokwelapha nabahlaziya igciwane ngaphandle kwegciwane le-SARS-CoV-2 eliqinisekiwe elebhu. Isilinganiso sabafayo kunabanegciwane sibonisa inani labafayo lihlukaniswe ngenani labahlonziwe phakathi nesikhathi esinikeziwe.	In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency virus codes to ICD-10, U07.1 who died of the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus and U07.2 who died of COVID-19 identified by medical and analytical staff outside the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mortality rate over infected indicates the death toll is divided by the number identified during the given period.
2027	en	zu	Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.

2028	en	zu	The number varies by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.	Inani liyahlukahluka kuye ngesifunda. Ezinye izindlela zihlanganisa i-case fatality rate (CFR), okubonisa iphesenti labahlonziwe ababulawa igciwane, ne-infection fatality rate (IFR), okubonisa iphesenti labantu abanegciwane (abahlonziwe nabangahlonziwe) ababulawa igciwane.	The number varies from region to region. Other methods include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of identified people who die from the virus, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected people (identified and not identified) killed by the virus.
2029	en	zu	These statistics are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.	Lezi zibalo azisekelwe esikhathini futhi zilandela inani labantu abathile kusukela ekungenweni igciwane kuya ekuxazululweni kwesigameko.	These figures are not based on time and follow the number of specific people from infection to case resolution.
2030	en	zu	While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.	Nakuba kungebona bonke abangenwe igciwane ababa nezakhi zesifo, ukuba khona kwezakhi zesifo kunganikeza ulwazi lokuthi bangaki abantu abanegciwane.	Although not all infected people have the components of the disease, the presence of disease components can provide information on how many people are infected.
2031	en	zu	In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.

2032	en	zu	In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified as such.	EGangelt, igciwane labhebhethekiswa imibuthano yeCarnival, futhi langena entsheni, okwabangela amanani aphansi okufa, futhi akubona bonke ababulawa yi-COVID-19 abaqashelwa ngokomthetho njengabanegciwane.	In Gangelt, the virus was rolled out at Carnival gatherings, and entered youth, resulting in low death rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths were officially recognized as infected.
2033	en	zu	Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, isistimu yezempilo yaseJalimane ayikabi namanani amakhulu.	Moreoverall, Germany's health system has yet to have large numbers.
2034	en	zu	In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed from blood donors.	ENetherlands, cishe u-3% kungenzeka unezakhi zesifo, njengoba kuhlole abathekelisi begazi.	In the Netherlands, about 3% are likely to have disease components, as tested by blood exporters.
2035	en	zu	69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.	Abangu-69 (u-0.004% wenani labantu) baqinisekisiwe ukuthi babulewe yi-COVID-19.	69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
2036	en	zu	The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.	Igalelo lomqedazwe nesilinganiso sabafayo kuyahluka kwabesilisa nakwabesifazane.	The contribution of the eradication and mortality rate varies from male to female.
2037	en	zu	Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.	Inani labafayo liphakeme kwabesilisa ocwaningweni oluqhutshwa eChina nase-Italy.	The death toll is higher for men in research conducted in China and Italy.
2038	en	zu	The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women closing only at 90.

2039	en	zu	In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.	EChina, isilinganiso sabantu abafayo sasingamaphesenti angu-2.8 kwabesilisa namaphesenti angu-1.7 kwabesifazane.	In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
2040	en	zu	The exact reasons for this sex-difference is not known, but genetic and behavioural factors could be a reason.	Izizathu okuyizonazona zalo mehluko azaziwa, kodwa izici zezakhi zofuzo nokuziphatha zingaba isizathu.	The underlying reasons for this difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors can be the reason.
2041	en	zu	Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.	Umehluko wabanegciwane osekelwe ebulilini, inani eliphansi labavame ukubhema kwabesifazane kanye nabesilisa ababa nezinye izimo zokugula njenge-hypertension besebancane kunabesifazane kungaba negalelo enanini eliphakeme labesilisa abafayo.	Differences in gender-based infections, lower rates of female and male asthma who have other health conditions such as hypertension at an early age than women can contribute to a higher number of male deaths.
2042	en	zu	In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.	E-Europe, u-57% wabantu abanegciwane ngabesilisa kanti u-72% walabo ababulawa yi-COVID-19 kwakungabesilisa.	In Europe, 57% of people infected are men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
2043	en	zu	As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.	Ngo-April 2020, uhulumeni wase-US awulandeleli idatha ehlobene nobulili wabanegciwane le-COVID-19.	In April 2020, the US government does not track gender-related data of COVID-19 infected people.

2064	en	zu	There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.	Kucwaningwa izindlela ezintathu zokugoma.	Three approaches to vaccination are being investigated.
2065	en	zu	First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine.	Okokuqala, abacwaningi bahlose ukwakha umuthi wokugomela igciwane.	First, the researchers aim to build a vaccine.
2066	en	zu	The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.	Inhloso yokusetshenziswa kwegciwane elinjengaleli, lingasebenzi noma lifile, iwukusungula ukusabela komzimba okulwa negciwane elisha le-COVID-19.	The purpose of the use of a virus such as this, inactive or dead, is to establish an immune response against the new COVID-19 virus.
2067	en	zu	A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.	Indlela yesibili, ama-subunit vaccines, ihlose ukusungula umgomo owenza amasosha omzimba asabele ezicini ezithile zegciwane.	The second approach, subunit vaccines, aims to establish a goal that makes the immune system respond to certain aspects of the virus.
2068	en	zu	In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor.	Uma kuyi-SARS-CoV-2, ucwaningo olunjalo lugxila kuphrotheni eyi-S-spike esiza igciwane lingene ku-ACE2 enzyme receptor.	If it is SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on an S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
2069	en	zu	A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).	Indlela yesithathu yimigomo ye-nucleic acid (imigomo ye-DNA noma i-RNA, indlela entsha yokwakha umgomo).	The third method is nucleic acid regulations (rules of DNA or RNA, a new method of policy building).
