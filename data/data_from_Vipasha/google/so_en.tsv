Isticmaalka fayruska noocan ah, oo aan firfircoonayn ama dhintay, waxaa loogu talo geley in jawaabta difaaca jidhka lagu carbiyo ee jidhka bilaa aadanka caabuqa cusub ee COVID-19.	The use of this type of virus, which is inactive or dead, is intended to stimulate the body&#39;s immune response to the new infection of COVID-19.
2066	en	so	The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.	Khidada labaad, lasoo baxa talaalka, waxaa lagu doonayaa in lagu ogaado xasaasinimada nidaamka difaaca ee fayrusyada qaar lala soco baxay.	The second step, after the vaccine is released, is to determine the sensitivity of the immune system to certain viruses.
2067	en	so	A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.	Marka la eego SARS-CoV-2, daraasadaha noocan ah waxaa diirada lagu saarayaa korodhka-S ee borootiinta ee ka caawinaysa fayruska qaadaha enzyme ACE2.	In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are focused on the increased S-protein that helps the virus transport the enzyme ACE2.

2081	en	so	However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal.	Maarso 28 2020, FDA waxay soo saartay ogolaansho isticmaal xaalada degdeg ah oo hydroxychloroquine iyo chloroquine oo uu ogolaaday dhakhtarka daawaynaya dadka qaba COVID-19. Nuqulka 7aad ee tilmaamaha Jayna waxa sidoo kale ku jira interferon, ribavirin ama umifenovir in loo isticmaalo COVID-19.	On March 28 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine approved by a physician treating people with COVID-19.

Nitrozoxanide was recommended for future use in in vivo studies after it was observed in low respiratory masses of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the upstream protein of serine-mediated transcriptional protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the ACE2 transporter.
2084	en	so	Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.

Oseltamivir ma xadido qaadashada SARS-CoV-2 vitro oo lama garanayo kaalinta ay ku leedahay daawaynta COVID-19.	Studies of chloroquine and hydroxchloroquine with or without azithromycin are too limited to prevent the medical community from accepting these treatments without a study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unknown.
