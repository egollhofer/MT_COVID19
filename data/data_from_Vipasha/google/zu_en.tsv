141	en	zu	Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.	Njengoba izimo zinqwabelane ezifundeni ezithile emazweni ase-EU/EEA nase-UK, futhi izibhedlela namayunithi okunakekelwa okubucayi ngokuvamile kusiza abantu abathile besifunda, ulwazi olumayelana nezimo kanye nemibhede yokunakekelwa okubucayi kufanele kutholakale ezingeni le-Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (I-NUTS-2).	As conditions are concentrated in certain regions in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units often serve a specific population in a region, information about conditions and intensive care beds should be available at the level of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS- 2).
142	en	zu	The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.	Okuhlangenwe nakho kwase-Italy kanye namathrendi amanje akwamanye amazwe abonisa ukuthi ubhubhane lwe-COVID-19 lukhula ngokushesha e-EU/EEA nase-UK.	The Italian experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
143	en	zu	Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.	Amazwe, izibhedlela namayunithi okunakekelwa okubucayi kufanele azilungiselele isimo sokuthelelana komphathi okuqhubekayo kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye nokwanda kweziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19 edinga ukunakekelwa kwezokwelashwa, futhi ikakhulukazi ukunakekelwa okubucayi, njengalokho okwenzeka ezifundeni ezithintekile e-Italy.	Countries, hospitals and critical care units must prepare for the situation of continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase of patients suffering from COVID-19 requiring medical care, and especially critical care, as is happening in the affected regions in Italy.
144	en	zu	As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.	Njengoba kuboniswe ekuhloleni kwakamuva kwe-ECDC kwengozi esheshayo, indlela esheshayo, enomdlandla neningilizayo ibalulekile ukulibazisa ukusakazeka kwe-SARS-COV-2, ngokwenza ushintsho olusuka endleleni elawulayo luye endleleni enciphisayo, njengoba ukwanda okusheshayo okulindelwe kwenani lezimo kungase kunganikezi abenzi bezinqumo nezibhedlela isikhathi esanele sokuqonda, sokwamukela nokuvumelanisa ukusabela kwabo kube indlela efanele uma kungasetshenzisiwe kusanesikhathi.	As shown in ECDC&#39;s recent assessment of the immediate risk, a quick, proactive and thorough approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making the transition from a control approach to a mitigation approach, since the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, to accept and adapt their reactions into the right way if not used early.
145	en	zu	The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.	Ukuhlola kwengozi esheshayo kuphinde kusho izinyathelo zempilo yomphakathi ukuze kulawulwe umthelela wobhubhane.	Rapid risk assessment also implies public health measures to manage the impact of the epidemic.

Ngakho-ke, kuyinselele kakhulu ukulawula umqedazwe we-SARS-CoV-2 kune-MERS-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV.	Therefore, it is more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
253	en	zu	Clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.	Ukuqalisa kwamaqoqo kuvame ukwenzeka kumndeni ofanayo noma kumbuthano ofanayo noma into yezokuthutha efana nomkhumbi wokungcebeleka.	Cluster initiations often occur in the same family or group or in a form of transportation such as a cruise ship.
254	en	zu	Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.	Iziguli ngokuvamile zinomlando wokuvakasha noma zihlala e-Wuhan noma ezinye izindawo ezithintekile noma ukuxhumana nabantu abathelelekile noma iziguli emavikini amabili akamuva ngaphambi kokuqala.	Patients usually have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the onset.
255	en	zu	However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends out an alarm to increase the time for quarantine.	Nokho, kuye kwabikwa ukuthi abantu bangakwazi ukuthwala igciwane ngaphandle kwezimpawu isikhathi eside kunamaviki amabili futhi iziguli ezilashiwe ezikhishiwe esibhedlela zingakwazi ukuphinde zithwale igciwane futhi, okukhipha isixwayiso sokunyusa isikhathi sokuzivalela.	However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and that treated patients who have been discharged from the hospital can become infected again, prompting a warning to increase the period of self-isolation.
256	en	zu	Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.	Iziguli zinenani elivamile noma elincishisiwe lamaseli amhlophe egazi ayi-peripheral (ikakhulukazi ama-lymphocyte) ezigabeni zokuqala.	Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stages.
257	en	zu	For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count &lt; 4×109/L including lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.	Ngokwesibonelo, i-lymphopenia enesibalo samaseli egazi amhlophe esithi < 4×109/L okuhlanganisa isibalo se-lymphocyte esithi < 1×109/L, kanye namazinga aphakeme e-aspartate aminotransferase kanye ne-viremia atholwa kuziguli ezingu-1,099 ezine-COVID-19.	For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of &lt; 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19 .
258	en	zu	The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.	Amazinga ama-enzyme esibindi nomsipha kanye ne-myoglobin ayephakeme egazini lezinye iziguli, futhi iphrotheni eyi-C-reactive kanye ne-erythrocyte sedimentation yayiphakeme egazini leziguli eziningi.	Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated in the blood of most patients.
259	en	zu	In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.	Kuziguli ezinokugula okubucayi, izinga le-D-dimer, umkhiqizo wokuwohloka kwe-fibrin okhona egazini, laliphakeme, futhi isibalo se-lymphocyte lalinciphe ngokuphawulekayo.	In patients with critical illness, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin breakdown product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was significantly reduced.
260	en	zu	Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.	Kwatholwa okungajwayelekile ku-radiography yesifuba yeziguli eziningi ezine-COVID-19 futhi okunezici zethunzi elinamapheshi akabili noma i-ground glass opacity emaphasheni.	Abnormalities were found on the chest radiographs of many patients with COVID-19 and characterized by double patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
261	en	zu	Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	Iziguli zivame ukuphathwa inyumoniya engavamile, ukulimala kwephaphu okubucayi, kanye ne-acute respiratory distress syndrome (I-ARDS).	Patients are often treated with atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
262	en	zu	When ARDS happens, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.	Lapho kwenzeka i-ARDS, ukuvuvukala okungalawuliwe, ukukhula koketshezi, kanye ne-fibrosis ethuthukayo kufaka engcupheni ukushintshana kwegesi.	When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis compromise gas exchange.
263	en	zu	Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.	Ukungasebenzi kahle kohlobo-I nohlobo-II lwe-pneumocyte kunciphisa izinga le-surfactant futhi kunyuse ukucindezeleka kwendawo engaphezulu, ngaleyo ndlela kuncishiswe ikhono lamaphaphu lokunwebeka futhi okunyusa ingozi yokuwa kwamaphaphu.	Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung&#39;s ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
264	en	zu	Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.	Ngakho-ke, imiphumela emibi kakhulu ye-radiography ivame ukufana nesimo esibucayi kakhulu sesifo.	Therefore, the worst results of radiography are often similar to the most serious condition of the disease.
265	en	zu	On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.	Ngo-February 18, 2020, ukuhlaziya kokuqala oku-pathological kwe-COVID-19 kwabonisa ukuxebuka kwama-pneumocyte, ukwakheka kolwelwesi lwe-hyaline, kanye nokufinyelelwa kwe-interstitial lymphocyte, kanye namaseli e-multinucleated syncytial emaphasheni esiguli esibulawe isifo, okuhambisana ne-pathology yesifo segciwane kanye ne-ARDS futhi okufana nalokho kweziguli ze-SARS ne-MERS.	On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the exfoliation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membrane, and the accumulation of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral disease and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
266	en	zu	The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.	Ukutholwa kwe-RNA ye-SARS-CoV-2 kusetshenziswa i-reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (I-RT-PCR) kwasetshenziswa njengombandela omkhulu wokuxilongwa kwe-COVID-19.	The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
267	en	zu	However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.	Nokho, ngenxa yenani eliphakeme lenegethivu engeyikho, engase isheshise umqedazwe, ukubonakala kwezokwelashwa kwaqala ukusetshenziswa lapho kuxilongwa (okwakungathembele kuphela ku-RT-PCR) e-China ngo-February 13, 2020.	However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, medical imaging was first used for diagnosis (which did not rely only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
268	en	zu	A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.	Kwavela isimo esifanayo lapho kuxilongwa i-SARS.	A similar situation arose when SARS was diagnosed.
269	en	zu	Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.	Ngakho-ke, inhlanganisela yomlando wesifo, ukubonakaliswa kwezokwelashwa, ukuhlolwa kwaselabhorethri, nemiphumela ye-radiological ibalulekile futhi isemqoka ukuze kwenziwe ukuxilongwa okuyimpumelelo.	Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological results is important and essential to make a successful diagnosis.
270	en	zu	On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.	Ngo-February 14, 2020, iqembu le-Feng Zhang lachaza iphrothokholi yokusebenzisa indlela ka-SHERLOCK esekelwe ku-CRISPR ukuze kutholwe i-SARS-CoV-2, ethola izingxenyana ezingezona ezemvelo ze-RNA ye-SARS-CoV-2 ku-20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (amakhophi angu-10-100 nge-microliter ngayinye yokufakiwe) kusetshenziswa induku yokugcobhoza enkathini engaphansi kwehora ngaphandle kokudinga amathuluzi ayinkimbinkimbi.	On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang&#39;s group described a protocol for using SHERLOCK&#39;s CRISPR-based method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects non-natural RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without the need for sophisticated equipment.
271	en	zu	Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.	Sithemba ukuthi indlela entsha izothuthukisa kakhulu ukuzwela nezinzuzo uma kuqinisekisiwe kumasampula ezokwelashwa.	We hope that the new method will greatly improve the sensitivity and benefits when validated in clinical samples.
272	en	zu	Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table ​(Table2).2).	Ngenxa yokuntula okuhlangenwe nakho nge-CoV entsha, odokotela ngokuyinhloko bangakwazi ukunikeza ukunakekelwa kokusekela kuziguli ze-COVID-19, kuyilapho bezama izinhlobonhlobo zezindlela zokwelapha ezisetshenzisiwe noma eziphakanyisiwe ngaphambilini ukuze kwelashwe amanye ama-CoV afana ne-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV nezinye izifo zamagciwane (Ithebula ​(Ithebula2).2).	Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can primarily provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or previously suggested to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and others bacterial infections (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ).
273	en	zu	These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.	Lokhu kwelashwa kuhlanganisa ukwelashwa kwamanje nokungase kube ukwelashwa ngemithi elwa namagciwane, ama-immunosuppressant, ama-steroid, i-plasma evela kuziguli eziluleme, imithi yama-Chinese, kanye nosizo lwezengqondo.	This treatment includes current and potential treatment with antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from convalescent patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
274	en	zu	Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.	Kwenziwa ngisho nesiphakamiso sokusebenzisa i-plasma yeziguli eziluleme njengendlela yokwelashwa.	It has even been proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients as a treatment.
275	en	zu	Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.	Izinkampani zama-pharmaceutical ziyaqhudelana ukuze zakhe izivikeli-mzimba nemigomo emelene negciwane.	Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and anti-viral vaccines.
276	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.	I-SARS-CoV-2 ngokuyinhloko ihlasela amaphaphu ekuqaleni futhi cishe iphinde ihlasele, ngokwezinga elincane, ezinye izitho zomzimba ezibonisa i-ACE2, njengesistimu ye-gastrointestinal kanye nezinso.	SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs of the body that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
277	en	zu	Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death.	Noma kunjalo, ukungasebenzi kahle kanye nokuhluleka kwendlela yokuphefumula kuwusongo olukhulu kuziguli futhi kuyimbangela enkulu yokufa.

334	en	zu	This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.	Lokhu kungenxa yokuthi i-SARS yathula eminyakeni engu-17 edlule futhi akukho ukugula kwayo okusha okuye kwabikwa kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.	This is because SARS became silent 17 years ago and no new cases of SARS have been reported since then.
335	en	zu	In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, izimo eziyimvela kancane kanye namaqoqo e-MERS ayaqhubeka evela e-Middle East futhi asakazeka nakwezinye izifunda ngenxa yokuphikelela kwemithombo yamagciwane asuka ezilwaneni aye kubantu ezindaweni ezinesifo.	On the other hand, milder cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of sources of infection from animals to humans in endemic areas.
336	en	zu	Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.	Amasu okugoma aye enzelwa i-MERS ngokuthi kusetshenziswe igciwane elingasebenzi, ama-plasmid e-DNA, ama-vector egciwane, ama-nanoparticle, izinhlayiya ezifana negciwane kanye namayunithi angaphansi ephrotheni eyinhlanganisela futhi amanye aye ahlolwa kumamodeli ezilwane.	Vaccine strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been tested in animal models.
337	en	zu	The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.	Ukwakhiwa komgomo ophephile nosebenzayo omelene ne-SARS-CoV-2 kubantu abathelelekayo kuwumsebenzi ophuthumayo nobalulekile ekulawuleni umqedazwe oqhubekayo.	The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in infected populations is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
338	en	zu	However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (averaged 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.	Nokho, kuyinselele ukumelana nobunzima ngenxa yenkathi ende (isilinganiso sezinyanga ezingu-18) edingekayo ukuze kwakhiwe umgomo kanye nezinhlobo ezishintshayo zama-CoV.	However, it is challenging due to the long period (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the evolving strains of CoVs.
339	en	zu	As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.	Njengesifo esisha, i-COVID-19 isanda kuqala ukubonisa uhlelo lwayo lwezokwelashwa olugcwele ezigulini eziyizinkulungwane.	As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical effect on thousands of patients.
340	en	zu	In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.	Ezimweni eziningi, iziguli zingakwazi ukululama kancane ngaphandle kwemiphumela yesifo sangaphambilini.	In many cases, patients can recover slowly without the effects of the previous disease.
341	en	zu	However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.	Nokho, ngokufana ne-SARS ne-MERS, i-COVID-19 iphinde ihlotshaniswe nezinga eliphakeme lokugula nokufa ezigulini ezinokugula okubucayi.	However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
342	en	zu	Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.	Ngakho-ke, ukwakha imodeli yembangela yesifo kubalulekile kuma-ejensi okunakekelwa kwezempilo ukuze kubekwe ekuqaleni amasevisi awo, ikakhulukazi ezindaweni ezinezinsiza ezincane.	Therefore, developing a causal model of disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
343	en	zu	Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table ​(Table33):	Ngokusekelwe kuzingcwaningo zokwelashwa ezibikwe kuze kube manje, izici ezilandelayo zingase zithinte noma zihlotshaniswe nembangela yeziguli ze-COVID-19 (Ithebula ​(Ithebula33):	Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the cause of COVID-19 patients (Table ​ (Table33):
344	en	zu	Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.	Ubudala: Ubudala babuyisici esibaluleke kakhulu sembangela ye-SARS, okuyiqiniso futhi nge-COVID-19.	Age: Age was a very important factor in the causation of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
345	en	zu	COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.	I-COVID-19 yavela ngokuyinhloko kubudala obungu-30-65 futhi u-47.7% walezo ziguli zazingaphezu kuka-50 kucwaningo lweziguli ezingu-8,866 njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla.	COVID-19 occurred primarily in the 30-65 age group and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in the study of 8,866 patients as described above.
346	en	zu	Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.	Iziguli ezazidinga ukunakekelwa kwezimo ezibucayi zazinethuba eliphakeme lokuphathwa ezinye izifo nezinkimbinkimbi futhi zazindala ngokuphawulekayo kunalezo ezingenazo (ubudala ongu-66 buqhathaniswa no-51), okusikisela ukuthi ubudala buyisici esiyimbangela kumphumela kuziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19.	Patients who required intensive care had a higher likelihood of co-morbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a contributing factor to outcome in patients with COVID-19.
347	en	zu	Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.	Ubulili: I-SARS-CoV-2 igulise abantu besilisa abaningi kunabantu besifazane (u-0.31/100,000 oqhathaniswa no-0.27/100,000), njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla.	Gender: SARS-CoV-2 sickens more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
348	en	zu	Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.	Izifo ezikhona kakade nezinkimbinkimbi: Iziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19 ezidinga ukunakekelwa okubucayi zinethuba eliphakeme lokuphathwa ukulimala kwenhliziyo okubucayi kanye ne-arrhythmia.	Pre-existing and complex diseases: Patients suffering from COVID-19 who require intensive care have a higher chance of being treated for serious heart damage and arrhythmia.
349	en	zu	Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients.	Izehlakalo ezihlobene nenhliziyo zaphinde zaba isizathu esiyinhloko sokufa kweziguli ezine-SARS.	Cardiovascular events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
350	en	zu	It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.	Kuphindwe kwabikwa ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 iyakwazi futhi ukunamathela kuma-ACE2-positive cholangiocyte, okungase kuholele ekungasebenzini kahle kwesibindi kuziguli eziphethwe i-COVID-19.	It has been repeatedly reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also able to adhere to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients suffering from COVID-19.
351	en	zu	It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.	Kuhle ukuphawula ukuthi ubudala kanye nesifo esikhona kakade kuhlobene nokuqinile futhi kungase kuphazamisane.	It is worth noting that age and pre-existing disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
352	en	zu	Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.	Imiphumela yaselabhorethri engavamile: Izinga lephrotheni ye-C-reactive (CRP) egazini ibonisa ubucayi bokuvuvukala noma ukulimala kwesicubu futhi kuye kwaphakanyiswa ukuthi kuyisici esingase sibe imbangela yesifo, ukusabela ekwelashweni, kanye nokululama okuphelele.	Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment, and overall recovery.
353	en	zu	The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.	Kuphinde kwenziwa ukuhlobana kwezinga le-CRP nobucayi nembangela ye-COVID-19.	Correlation of CRP level with severity and cause of COVID-19 was also done.
354	en	zu	In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, i-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ephakeme, i-aspartate aminotransferase (AST), i-alanine aminotransferase (ALT), kanye ne-creatine kinase (CK) ingase futhi isize ukubikezela umphumela.	In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcome.
355	en	zu	These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.	Lawa ma-enzyme aboniswa kabanzi ezithweni eziningi, ikakhulukazi enhliziyweni nakusibindi, futhi kukhululwa phakathi nokulimala kwesicubu.	These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
356	en	zu	Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.	Ngenxa yalokho, ziyizinkomba ezivamile zokungasebenzi kahle kwenhliziyo noma isibindi.	As a result, they are common indicators of heart or liver dysfunction.
357	en	zu	Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.	Izimpawu zokwelashwa ezinkulu: I-radiography yesifuba nokuqhubeka kwesikhashana kwezimpawu zokwelashwa kufanele zicatshangelwe ndawonye nezinye izinkinga zokubikezelwa kwemiphumela nezinkimbinkimbi ze-COVID-19.	Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
358	en	zu	Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.	Ukusetshenziswa kwama-steroid: Njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla, ama-steroid angama-immunosuppressant ngokuvamile asetshenziswa njengokwelashwa kokwenezela kwezifo ezithelelanayo ukuze kuncishiswe ubucayi komonakalo wokuvuvukala.	Use of steroids: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as adjunctive therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
359	en	zu	Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality.	Njengoba kusetshenziswe kabanzi inani eliphakeme lama-corticosteroid kuziguli ezine-SARS ebucayi, iningi labantu abasinda babephethwe i-avascular osteonecrosis benokukhubazeka kokuphila kwabo konke nezinga lokuphila elingelihle.	Because of the widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, the majority of survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and a poor quality of life.
360	en	zu	Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.	Ngenxa yalokho, uma edingekile, ama-steroid kufanele asetshenziswe ngesilinganiso esiphansi futhi isikhathi esifushane kuziguli ze-COVID-19.	As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
361	en	zu	Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.	Ukucindezeleka komqondo: Njengoba kuchazwe ngenhla, phakathi nokubheduka kwe-COVID-19 iziguli eziningi zaphathwa ukucindezeleka okukhulu njengoba kwakufanele zibekezelele izinkathi ezide zokuzivalela nokungaqiniseki okukhulu futhi zibona ukufa kwamalungu omndeni aseduze kanye neziguli ezikanye nazo.	Psychological stress: As explained above, during the outbreak of COVID-19 many patients suffered from severe stress as they had to endure long periods of isolation and great uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
362	en	zu	It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.	Kusemqoka ukuthi kunikezwe ukwelulekwa komqondo nokusekelwa kwesikhathi eside ukuze kusizwe lezi ziguli zilulame ekucindezelekeni futhi zibuyele empilweni evamile.	It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from depression and return to normal life.
363	en	zu	According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.	Ngokuvumelana nezingcwaningo zolwazi lwabantu kuze kube manje, i-COVID-19 ibonakala inezici ze-epidemiological ezihlukile ku-SARS.	Consistent with human data studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
364	en	zu	In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.	Ngaphezu kokuphindeka kumgudu wokuphefumula ongezansi, i-SARS-CoV-2 iyakwazi ukuphindeka kalula kumgudu wokuphefumula ongenhla futhi ibangele izimpawu ezincane noma ingazibangeli esigabeni sokuqala sokutheleleka, ngendlela efanayo nama-CoV abangela imikhuhlane evamile.	In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can easily replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to CoVs that cause common colds.
365	en	zu	Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.	Ngakho-ke, iziguli ezithelelekile esigabeni sokuqala noma enkathini yokufukanyelwa zingakhiqiza inani elikhulu legciwane phakathi nemisebenzi yansuku zonke, okubangela ubunzima obukhulu bokulawulwa komqedazwe.	Therefore, infected patients in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, which causes great difficulties in epidemic control.
366	en	zu	However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.	Nokho, ukutheleleka kwe-SARS-CoV kwakucatshangwa ukuthi kwenzeka lapho iziguli zazigula kakhulu, kuyilapho ukutheleleka okuningi kungazange kwenzeke esigabeni sokuqala.	However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
367	en	zu	Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.	Ngenxa yalokho, ukubheduka kwe-COVID-19 kubucayi kakhulu futhi kunzima ukukulawula kunokubheduka kwe-SARS.	As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
368	en	zu	Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	Kunemizamo eminingi eqhubekayo njengamanje e-China okuhlanganisa ukuvalwa thaqa kwe-Wuhan namadolobha azungezile nokuzivalela okuqhubekayo kwaso sonke isibalo sabantu ngethemba lokuphazamisa ukudluliswa kwe-SARS-CoV-2.	There are many efforts currently underway in China including the complete lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing lockdown of the entire population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
369	en	zu	Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.	Nakuba lezi zinyathelo ziwulimaze kakhulu umnotho neminye imikhakha yezwe, inani leziguli ezintsha liyancipha, okubonisa ukuncipha kwejubane lomqedazwe.	Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowing of the epidemic.
370	en	zu	The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.	Isilinganiso esithembisa kakhulu esokuthi ukubheduka kuzophela ngo-March futhi isigaba sokuncipha sizoqhubeka izinyanga ezingu-3-4.	The most promising estimate is that the shedding will end in March and the thinning phase will continue for 3-4 months.
371	en	zu	However, some other experts are not that optimistic.	Nokho, ezinye izazi azinalo lelo themba.	However, some scholars are not so optimistic.
372	en	zu	Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.	U-Paul Hunter, et al., ulinganisa ukuthi i-COVID-19, ebonakala ithelelana kakhulu kune-SARS, ngeke iphele ngo-2020.	Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not be gone by 2020.
373	en	zu	Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.	U-Ira Longini, et al., wasungula imodeli yokubikezela umphumela womqedazwe futhi wasikisela ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 ingase iphathe izingxenye ezimbili kwezintathu zesibalo sabantu emhlabeni wonke.	Ira Longini, et al., developed a model for predicting the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world&#39;s population.
374	en	zu	A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which indicates that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.	Iqembu lase-Canada labika ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 yatholwa kuwo womabili amaswabhu e-mid-turbinate kanye nawomphimbo eziguli ezalulama futhi zaphuma esibhedlela emavikini amabili ngaphambilini, okubonisa ukuthi igciwane elisanda kutholwa kungenzeka ukuthi libe isiqephu esiphindayo esifana nemfuluwenza.	A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly detected virus may be a reoccurring influenza-like episode.
375	en	zu	However, promising signs have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating the current strategies might have been working.	Nokho, izimpawu ezithembisayo zivele e-China ngokusekelwe enanini elehlayo labantu abasha abagulayo, okubonisa ukuthi amasu amanje kungenzeka ukuthi ayasebenza.	However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
376	en	zu	Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.	Ekuqaleni kwakubikezelwe ukuthi i-Ebola yayizophatha abantu abayisigidi futhi kufe ingxenye yesigidi sabantu.	It was originally predicted that Ebola would infect a million people and kill half a million people.
377	en	zu	However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been put under control.	Nokho, ngenxa yokuzivalela nokuzihlukanisa okuqinile, isifo sigcine silawuliwe.	However, due to strict isolation and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
378	en	zu	It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.	Kungenzeka, njenge-SARS-CoV, ukuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 ingase ibe buthaka ingabi namandla futhi ekugcineni iphele noma ibe igciwane elingagulisi kakhulu elikwazi ukuphilisana nabantu.	It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and eventually die out or become a less pathogenic virus that can coexist in humans.
379	en	zu	A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. ​(Fig.55).	Ukuqhathaniswa komqedazwe we-COVID-19 nalowo we-SARS kanye ne-MERS kunikezwa ngezansi (Umfa. ​(Umfa.55).	A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Ref. ​(Ref.55).
380	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.	I-SARS-CoV-2 ithelelana kakhulu ngokukhwehlela noma ukuthimula, futhi kungenzeka ukuthi ngokuthintana okuqondile nezinto ezinegciwane.	SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread by coughing or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with infected objects.
381	en	zu	The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.	Igciwane laphinde futhi latholwa endleni, okuveza ithuba elisha lokudluliselwa okusuka endleni kuye emlonyeni.	The virus was also detected in feces, presenting a new possibility of faecal-to-mouth transmission.
382	en	zu	A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers.	Ucwaningo lwakamuva lweziguli ezingu-138 lwabika ukuthi u-41% weziguli kungenzeka ukuthi zatheleleka ezibhedlela, okuhlanganisa iziguli ezingu-17 ezazivele ziphethwe ezinye izifo ngaphambilini kanye nabanakekeli bezempilo abangu-40.	A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of patients may have acquired the infection in hospitals, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 health care workers.
383	en	zu	Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.	Ngenxa yalokho, kufanele kusetshenziswe ukuqapha okukhulu ukuze kuvikelwe abantu, ikakhulukazi abahlinzeki bokunakekelwa kwezempilo, osonhlalakahle, amalungu omndeni, ozakwabo, ngisho nabantu abame eduze kweziguli noma abantu abathelelekile.	As a result, extreme caution should be used to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even people who stand near patients or infected people.
384	en	zu	The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.	Umugqa wokuqala wokuvikeleka ongase usetshenziswe ukuze kwehliswe ubungozi bokutheleleka uwukugqoka amamaski obuso; kokubili ukusetshenziswa kwemaski yokuhlinzwa kanye namamaski e-N95 respirator (uchungechunge # 1860s) kusiza ukulawula ukubhebhetheka kwamagciwane.	The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of germs.
385	en	zu	Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.	Amamaski obuso okuhlinza avimba amaconsana awuketshezi avela kumuntu okungenzeka ukuthi uthelelekile ukuthi angahambi ngomoya futhi anamathele ebusweni bezinto, lapho engadluliselwa khona kwabanye abantu.	Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected person from becoming airborne and sticking to surfaces, where they can be transmitted to other people.
386	en	zu	However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are approximately 85 nm.	Nokho, amamaski e-N95 (uchungechunge # 1860s) kuphela angakwazi ukukuvikela ekuhogeleni ama-virion amancane ngo-10 kuye ku-80 nm, kuyilapho u-5% kuphela wama-virion okwazi ukudlula ngokuphelele; i-SARS-CoV-2 inosayizi ofanayo nowe-SARS-CoV kokubili kucishe kube ngu-85 nm.	However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect you from inhaling virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of virions can pass through completely; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV both are about 85 nm.
387	en	zu	Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.	Njengoba izinhlayiya zikwazi ukudlula kumamaski okuhlinza amahlanu ahlanganisiwe, abahlinzeki bezempilo abasebenza ngokuqondile neziguli kumelwe bagqoke amamaski e-N95 (uchungechunge # 1860s) hhayi amamaski okuhlinza.	Since particles can pass through five-ply surgical masks, healthcare providers working directly with patients must wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) and not surgical masks.
388	en	zu	In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.	Ngaphezu kwamamaski, abahlinzeki bokunakekelwa kwezempilo kufanele bagqoke amagawuni okuzivikela abalingana kahle ukuze kuncishiswe ngokwengeziwe ukuthintana namagciwane.	In addition to masks, health care providers should wear well-fitting protective gowns to further reduce exposure to pathogens.
389	en	zu	Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.	Amagciwane angakwazi ukungena kumuntu ngamehlo.	Bacteria can enter a person through the eyes.

521	en	zu	Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.	Ukuqhathanisa nokuhlukanisa i-SARS-CoV-2 namanye ama-HCoV ayisithupha kuveza ukufana nokuhluka okuthakazelisa kakhulu.	Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from six other HCoVs reveals some very interesting similarities and differences.
522	en	zu	First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.	Okokuqala, inkathi yokufukanyelwa kanye nobude besikhathi sokuqhubeka kwesifo se-HCoV kufana kakhulu.	First, the incubation period and duration of disease progression of HCoV are very similar.
523	en	zu	In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.	Ngokuqondene nalokhu, i-SARS-CoV-2 ilandela ithrendi evamile yamanye ama-HCoV ayisithupha.	In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
524	en	zu	Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).	Okwesibili, ubucayi bezimpawu ze-COVID-19 buphakathi kwe-SARS-CoV kanye nama-HCoV amane atholwa emphakathini (okungukuthi i-HCoV-229E, i-HCoV-OC43, i-HCoV-HKU1 kanye ne-HCoV-NL63).	Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
525	en	zu	On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, isifo se-SARS-CoV-2 sibonisa izici ezivame ukubonwa phakathi nokutheleleka ngama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini, okubandakanya ukungabikhona kwezimpawu ezicacile, izimpawu ezincane noma ukungabikhona kwezimpawu.	On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 disease shows characteristics that are often observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the absence of clear symptoms, mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
526	en	zu	On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, isethi engaphansi encane yezimo ezibucayi ze-COVID-19 ingabonwa futhi njengasesimweni sesifo se-SARS-CoV, nakuba isilinganiso siphansi kancane.	On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV disease, although the rate is slightly lower.
527	en	zu	Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.	Okwesithathu, ukuthelelana kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuphinde kubonise amaphethini athakazelisayo anesici sawo womabili ama-HCoV atholakala emphakathini kanye ne-SARS-CoV.	Third, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns that are characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
528	en	zu	On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, ukudluliswa kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuphakeme njengokwama-HCoV atholwe emphakathini.	On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
529	en	zu	On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, kusazoqinisekiswa ukuthi ukudluliselwa kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuyancipha yini kubantu njengasesimweni se-SARS-CoV ne-MERS-CoV.	On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
530	en	zu	Finally, same as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.	Okokugcina, ngokufana namanye ama-HCoV, i-SARS-CoV-2 ingatholwa kumasampula endle.	Finally, similar to other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
531	en	zu	Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.	Ukuthi ukudluliswa ngendle-ngomlomo kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kudlala indima ebalulekile yini uma kuziwa ku-SARS-CoV ngaphansi kwezimo ezithile kusazocaciswa izingcwaningo zesikhathi esizayo.	Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CoV under certain conditions remains to be clarified by future studies.
532	en	zu	It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.	Kuphinde kuthakazelise kakhulu ukubona ukuthi ingabe i-SARS-CoV-2 izobonisa ukuvela ngezinkathi ezithile zonyaka njengoba kunjalo ngama-HCoV atholakala emphakathini.	It will also be very interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will show seasonality as is the case with community-acquired HCoVs.
533	en	zu	Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.	Noma kunjalo, izici ze-SARS-CoV-2 okubandakanya ukutheleleka kwayo, i-pathogenicity nokubhebhetheka okulondolozekayo ngemva kokudlulela kubantu kuzoba nethonya esiphethweni sokugcina sokubheduka okuqhubekayo kwe-COVID-19.	However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission to humans will influence the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
534	en	zu	All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.	Wonke ama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini abangela izimpawu ezincane azivumelanise kahle nabantu.	All community-acquired HCoVs cause mild symptoms and are well adapted to humans.
535	en	zu	From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.	Ngokomunye umbono, kungase futhi kube yiqiniso ukuthi abantu bazivumelanise kahle nalawa ma-HCoV amane.	From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
536	en	zu	In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.	Ngamanye amazwi, kokubili kungenzeka ukuthi kwasinda kubhubhane lwe-HCoV yasendulo.	In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
537	en	zu	HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.	Ama-HCoV abangela izifo ezibucayi kubantu futhi abantu abaphathwa izifo ze-HCoV ebucayi abasekho.	HCoVs cause severe disease in humans and people with severe HCoV infections are no longer infected.
538	en	zu	For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.	Ukuze kwenzeke lokhu, ama-HCoV kufanele aphindeke kubantu ngokwezinga elanele ukuze kuvunyelwe ukukhula koshintsho oluvumelana nezimo okuphikisana nezici zokukhawulwa kombungazi.	For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans at a rate sufficient to allow the development of adaptive mutations that counteract the host&#39;s limiting factors.
539	en	zu	In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.	Ngale ndlela, uma ukubheduka kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kuphikelela futhi ithelela abantu abaningi, kuzoba nethuba elikhulu lokuthi izozivumelanisa kakhulu nabantu.	In this way, if the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 persists and infects more people, there will be a greater chance that it will become more human-adapted.
540	en	zu	If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.	Uma izivumelanisa kahle kakhulu, ukuthelela kwayo abantu kungabanzima ukukuvimba ngokuzivalela noma ezinye izindlela zokulawula ukutheleleka.	If it is highly adaptive, its spread to humans can be difficult to prevent through isolation or other infection control measures.
541	en	zu	For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.	Sekuyiminyaka eminingi, ama-CoV amane atholwa emphakathini ejikeleza emphakathini wabantu, okubangela umkhuhlane ovamile kubantu abanokusabela okufanele kwamasosha omzimba.	For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, causing the common cold in people with an adequate immune response.
542	en	zu	These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.	Lawa magciwane awadingi umthombo oyisilwane.	These bacteria do not need an animal source.
543	en	zu	In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.	Ngokuphambene nalokho, i-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV e-pathogenic kakhulu awakazivumelanisi kahle nabantu futhi ukuthelelana kwawo ngaphakathi kwabantu akukwazi ukulondolozwa.	In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their infectivity within humans cannot be maintained.
544	en	zu	They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.	Adinga ukuzigcina asesimweni futhi akhule kumthombo wawo we-zoonotic futhi afuna ithuba lokudlulela kuzisulu ezingachayeka, cishe ngombungazi omaphakathi oyedwa noma ngaphezulu futhi kukhuliswe ababungazi.	They need to survive and grow in their zoonotic source and seek the opportunity to pass to susceptible victims, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and rearing hosts.
545	en	zu	SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.	I-SARS-CoV-2 inezici ezifana nakho kokubili i-SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV kanye nama-HCoV amane atholwa emphakathini.	SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
546	en	zu	It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.	Itheleleka kakhulu njengama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini, okungenani kusidalwa sokuqala.	It is highly contagious like community-acquired HCoVs, at least in the first organism.
547	en	zu	However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.	Nokho, i-pathogenic kakhulu kunama-HCoV atholwa emphakathini futhi ine-pathogenic encane ku-SARS-CoV noma i-MERS-CoV.	However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
548	en	zu	It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.	Kusazobonwa ukuthi izozivumelanisa ngokugcwele yini nabantu futhi ijikeleze ngaphandle komthombo noma umbungazi wesilwane omaphakathi.	It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate without a source or intermediate animal host.
549	en	zu	Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.	Ngaphambi kokuthi kuxoxwe ngemisuka eyizilwane yama-HCoV, kuzosiza ukuthi sixoxe ngezincazelo nezici zababungazi boshintsho, abangokwemvelo, abawumthombo, abamaphakathi nabokukhulisa ama-HCoV.	Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the adaptive, natural, source, intermediate and breeding hosts of HCoVs.
550	en	zu	An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.	Isilwane siba umbungazi woshintsho we-HCoV uma sifukamele ukhokho ohlobene ngokuseduze okwabelwana naye nge-homology ephakeme ezingeni lokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	An animal becomes a transitional host for HCoV when it harbors a closely related ancestor with which it shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
551	en	zu	The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.	Igciwane eliwukhokho livame ukuzivumelanisa kahle futhi alikubangeli ukugula kulo mbungazi.	The progenitor virus usually adapts well and does not cause illness in the host.
552	en	zu	Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.	Ngokufanayo, umbungazi owumthombo ufukamela i-HCoV ngokuqhubekayo futhi isikhathi eside.	Similarly, the source host incubates HCoV continuously and for a long time.
553	en	zu	In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.	Kuzo zombili izimo, ababungazi batheleleka ngokwemvelo futhi bangababungazi abangokwemvelo be-HCoV noma igciwane layo elingumzali.	In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
554	en	zu	In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.	Ngokuphambene nalokho, uma i-HCoV yethulwa kabusha kumbungazi omaphakathi ngaphambili noma ngasekwethulweni kubantu, ayizivumelanisile kahle nombungazi omusha futhi ngokuvamile ibangela ukugula.	Conversely, if HCoV is reintroduced to an intermediate host before or near introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes disease.
555	en	zu	This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.	Lo mbungazi omaphakathi angase abe umthombo oyi-zoonotic yokutheleleka kwabantu futhi adlale indima yokukhulisa umbungazi okuvumela igciwane ukuthi liphindeke isikhashana futhi lidluliselwe kubantu ukuze kukhuliswe izinga lokutheleleka kwabantu.	This intermediate host may be a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of host amplification allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and be transmitted to humans to increase the rate of human infection.
556	en	zu	An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.	I-HCoV ingabhekana nokutheleleka kokugcina uma ingakwazi ukulondoloza ukutheleleka kwayo ngaphakathi kombungazi omaphakathi.	HCoV can undergo terminal infection if it cannot maintain its infectivity within an intermediate host.
557	en	zu	On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.	Ngokuphambene nalokho, ama-HCoV ayakwazi ukuzivumelanisa nombungazi omaphakathi futhi aze asungule ne-endemicity yesikhathi eside.	In contrast, HCoVs are able to adapt to an intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
558	en	zu	In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.	Kulesi simo, umbungazi omaphakathi uba umbungazi owumthombo ongokwemvelo.	In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural source host.
559	en	zu	Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.	Idatha ye-epidemiological yabonisa ukuthi lapho kubhekwa emuva ukuthi isiguli esiyinkomba ye-SARS sasinomlando wokuxhumana nezilwane ezizingelwayo.	Epidemiological data showed that retrospectively the reference patient for SARS had a history of contact with wild animals.
560	en	zu	Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.	Izingcwaningo ze-seroprevalence ezalandela zabonisa ukuthi abahwebi bezilwane babe ne-IgG emelene SARS-CoV ephakeme uma beqhathaniswa nesibalo sabantu abavamile.	Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that animal traders had higher IgG against SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
561	en	zu	Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.	Ama-masked palm civet (i-paguma larvata) kanye nenja ye-racoon ezimakethe zezilwane eziphilayo kwatholwa ukuthi athwala amagciwane afana nawe-SARS-CoV acishe afane ne-SARS-CoV.	Masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
562	en	zu	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.	Lokhu kwasekelwa ngokungaqondile iqiniso lokuthi ayikho i-SARS eyengeziwe eyabikwa ngemva kokubulawa kwawo wonke ama-civet ezimakethe.	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no additional SARS was reported after all the civets were killed in the markets.
563	en	zu	However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.	Nokho, kuye kwabikwa ukuthi ama-masked palm civet asendle noma emapulazini angakaze achayeke ezimakethe zezilwane eziphilayo ayenegethivu uma kuziwa ku-SARS-CoV, okusikisela ukuthi ama-masked palm civet angase abe umbungazi wokukhulisa omaphakathi kodwa hhayi umthombo ongokwemvelo we-SARS-CoV.	However, it has been reported that wild or farmed masked palm civets that have not been exposed to live animal markets were negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be an intermediate host but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
564	en	zu	Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.	Kuyaphawuleka, ukuthi u-80% wezilwane ezihlukahlukene ezimakethe zase-Guangzhou zinezivikeli-mzimba ezimelene ne-SARS-CoV, asikwazi ukushalazela ithuba lokuthi izilwane eziningi ezincelisayo zingababungazi abakhulisayo abamaphakathi be-SARS-CoV.	It is noteworthy, that 80% of various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
565	en	zu	All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.	Zonke lezi zibonakala zingababungazi bokugcina be-SARS-CoV.	All of these appear to be the definitive hosts of SARS-CoV.
566	en	zu	Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.	Ucwaningo olwalandela lombungazi oyisilwane esingokwemvelo se-SARS-CoV lwaveza i-CoV ehlobene ngokuseduze nelulwane, ebizwa ngokuthi i-SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), etholakala kumalulwane abizwa ngesicathulo sehhashi ase-Chine.	Subsequent studies of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
567	en	zu	These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.	Lawa malulwane aphozithivu uma kuziwa kuzivikeli-mzimba ezimelene ne-SARS-CoV kanye nokulandelana kwezakhi zofuzo ze-SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.	These bats are positive when it comes to antibodies against SARS-CoV and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
568	en	zu	This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.	Le kanye namanye ama-CoV elulwane abelana ngo-88-92% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide ne-SARS-CoV.	This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
569	en	zu	These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.	Lezi zingcwaningo ziholele ekusungulweni kombono omusha wokuthi amalulwane abungaza ama-pathogen amasha abantu.	These studies led to the development of a new hypothesis that bats host new human pathogens.
570	en	zu	Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.	Ama-CoV afana ne-SARS (ama-SL-CoV) aphawulwe kumalulwane, kodwa awekho ngaphandle kwaleyo ebizwa ngokuthi i-WIV1 akwazi ukuhlukaniswa njengegciwane eliphilayo.	SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none other than WIV1 can be classified as a live virus.
571	en	zu	Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.	I-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (I-ACE2) yabantu yaziwa njengesisabeli se-SARS-CoV.	Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a response to SARS-CoV.
572	en	zu	WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry.	I-WIV1 ethathwe kusampula lendle yamalulwane kwaboniswa ukuthi isebenzisa ilulwane, i-civet kanye ne-ACE2 yabantu njengesisabeli sokungena kuseli.	WIV1 derived from a bat faecal sample was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as a cell entry receptor.
573	en	zu	Intriguingly, sera of convalescent SARS patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1.	Ngokuthakazelisayo, i-sera yeziguli ezilulame ku-SARS yayikwazi ukubulala i-WIV1.	Interestingly, sera from patients who recovered from SARS were able to kill WIV1.
574	en	zu	Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.	Kuze kube manje, i-WIV1 imelele ukhokho ohlobene ngokuseduze we-SARS-CoV kumalulwane, yabelana ngo-95% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of nucleotide sequence homology.
575	en	zu	Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.	Nakuba kune-homology ephakeme phakathi kwalawa magciwane amabili, kukholelwa ngokuvamile ukuthi i-WIV1 ayilona igciwane elingumzali oseduze we-SARS-CoV futhi amalulwane awayena umbungazi oseduze we-SARS-CoV.	Although there is high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
576	en	zu	Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.	Ukuhlaziywa kwe-phylogenetic kuhlanganisa i-MERS-CoV neqembu elifanayo nelulwane le-CoV-HKU4 kanye nelulwane le-CoV-HKU5.	Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV with the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
577	en	zu	Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.	I-CoV-HKU4 yelulwane kanye ne-MERS-CoV kusebenzisa isisabeli sombungazi esifanayo, i-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), ekungeneni kwegciwane.	Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host effector, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
578	en	zu	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.	Ukulandelana kwe-polymerase ye-RNA ethembele ku-RNA ye-MERS-CoV isondelene ngoku-phylogenetically kozakwabo bama-beta-CoV elulwane atholwe e-Europe nase-Africa.	The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically close to its bat beta-CoV counterparts found in Europe and Africa.
579	en	zu	Up to now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.	Kuze kube manje, ayikho i-MERS-CoV ephilayo etholakala kumalulwane asendle.	To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
580	en	zu	MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.	I-MERS-CoV kanye nesihlobo sayo esiseduze i-CoV-HKU25 yelulwane kwabelana kuphela ngo-87% we-homology yokulandelana kwe-nucleotide.	MERS-CoV and its close relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
581	en	zu	Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.	Ngenxa yalokho, amalulwane angase angabi umbungazi owumthombo oseduze we-MERS-CoV.	As a result, bats may not be the proximate host for MERS-CoV.
582	en	zu	On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries.

On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for antibodies that kill MERS-CoV directly, similar to camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
583	en	zu	Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV.	I-MERS-CoV ephilayo efana negciwane elitholwe kubantu yahlukaniswa kuswabhu yasekhaleni yamakamela e-dromedary, okwabonisa ngokuqhubekayo ukuthi amakamela angumbungazi ongumthombo wangempela we-MERS-CoV.	A live MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further demonstrating that camels are the true source host for MERS-CoV.
584	en	zu	It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.	Kuyaphawuleka futhi ukuthi ngokuvamile kwabonwa izimpawu ezincane kodwa ukukhishwa okukhulu kwegciwane kumakamela athelelekile nge-MERS-CoV ngokocwaningo.	It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms but high viral shedding were observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV according to the study.
585	en	zu	Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.	Kuyaphawuleka, ukuthi amakamela athelelekile awagcinanga ukukhipha amagciwane ngomgudu wokuphefumula kuphela kodwa futhi nangomgudu wendle-womlomo, okuphinde kube umzila oyinhloko wokukhishwa kwegciwane elivela kumalulwane.	It is noteworthy, that the infected camels not only shed the bacteria through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the main route of shedding of the virus from bats.
586	en	zu	However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.	Nokho, imibuzo isasele njengoba ukugula okuningi kwe-MERS kungenawo umlando wokuxhumana namakamela ngaphambi kokuqala kwezimpawu, kungenzeka ukuthi ukuthelelana okusuka kumuntu kuye komunye noma imizila yokuthelelana engaziwa ehilela izilwane ezingaziwa ezifukamela i-MERS-CoV.	However, questions remain as most MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animals harboring MERS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
588	en	zu	As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.	Njengoba kunjalo nge-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV, ukuhlukahluka kokulandelana phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-RaTG13 kukhulu kakhulu ukuthi kungabelwa ubudlelwano bomzali.	As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign a parentage relationship.
589	en	zu	That is to say, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.	Lokho kusho ukuthi, amalulwane kungenzeka ukuthi awayena umbungazi owumthombo oseduze we-SARS-CoV-2 ngaphandle kwalapho kutholwa ama-CoV elulwane acishe afane esikhathini esizayo.	That said, bats are unlikely to be the proximate host for SARS-CoV-2 unless similar bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
590	en	zu	Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicative of a probable animal-to-human transmission event.	Kucatshangelwa ukuthi, ababungazi besilwane esimaphakathi se-SARS-CoV-2 kufanele babe phakathi kwezilwane zasendle ezidayiswa futhi zibulawe e-Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, iningi lazo lalihlobene nokugula kokuqala kwe-COVID-19, okubonisa ukuthi kungenzeka ukuthi kwaba nesenzakalo sokuthelelana okusuka kuzilwane kuye kubantu.	Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the initial illness of COVID-19, indicating that there may have been an event of transmission from animals to humans .
591	en	zu	Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.

595	en	zu	In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.	Ngokungafani okukhulu, ama-RBD e-SARS-CoV-2 ne-RaTG13 ahlukene kakhulu, nakuba kunezinga eliphakeme le-genome ebanzi yokulandelana kwe-homology.	In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly divergent, although there is a high degree of genome-wide sequence homology.
596	en	zu	An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.	Ucwaningo lwangaphambilini lwama-pangolin agulayo lwabika ukutholwa kwama-contig egciwane kumasampula amaphaphu, okubonakala ehlobene ngokufanayo ne-SARS-CoV-2.

597	en	zu	This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.	Lolu cwaningo lwasebenzisa izindlela zokwakhiwa ezihlukahlukene kanye nokuhlelwa okwenziwa ngesandla ukuze kwakhiwe ukulandelana kwe-genome eyingxenye eyakhiwa cishe u-86.3% wobude obuphelele be-genome yegciwane.	This study used various construction methods and manual sequencing to construct a partial genome sequence that made up approximately 86.3% of the total length of the viral genome.
598	en	zu	We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.	Asikwazi ukubekela eceleni ithuba lokuthi i-pangolin ingesinye sezilwane ezingababungazi abaseduze be-SARS-CoV-2.	We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the animals that are the closest hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
599	en	zu	However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.	Nokho, okwamanje abukho ubufakazi obusekela ukuthi i-pangolin ingumsuka oqondile we-SARS-CoV-2 ngenxa yokuhlukahluka kokulandelana phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolin ehlobene nama-beta-CoV.	However, there is currently no evidence to support that the pangolin is the direct source of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
600	en	zu	In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, ibanga eliphakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-RaTG13 lifushane nakakhulu phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolini ehlobene nama-beta-CoV.	In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolini SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
601	en	zu	The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.	Umgudu wokuziphendukela we-SARS-CoV-2 kumalulwane, ama-pangolin nezinye izilwane ezincelisayo usazotholwa.	The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be discovered.
602	en	zu	Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.	Nakuba i-homology yokulandelana okuphakeme itholiwe kuma-RBD phakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ne-pangolin, i-SARS-CoV-2 ehlobene nama-beta-CoV, i-SARS-CoV-2 ne-RaTG13 kwabelana nge-homology ephakeme yokulandelana kwe-genome ebanzi.	Although high sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share homology high-throughput genome-wide sequencing.
603	en	zu	It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.	Kunezinsolo eziphakeme zokuthi izinga eliphakeme lokufana phakathi kwama-RBD e-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolini ehlobene nama-beta-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 kuqhutshwa ukuziphendukela kokuhlangana okuxhumana ngokukhethwa.	There is a strong suspicion that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolini SARS-CoV-2 relative to beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the evolution of interaction through selection.
604	en	zu	A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.	Esinye isiphakamiso sincoma ukuhlanganiswa kabusha okuphakathi kwe-SARS-CoV-2 ye-pangolini ehlobene ne-beta-CoV kanye ne-RaTG13 kusilwane sesithathu sasendle.	Another proposal suggests recombination between pangolini SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal.

606	en	zu	The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.	Isiphetho asikafinyelelwa ngokuqondene nomsuka we-zoonotic eseduze ye-SARS-CoV-2.	A conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the near-zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
607	en	zu	Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.	Ngaphandle kwama-HCoV a-pathogenic kakhulu, umsuka we-zoonotic ye-HCoV-229E, i-HCoV-OC43, i-HCoV-NL63 kanye ne-HCoV-HKU1 nawo ucwaningiwe.	Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
608	en	zu	Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.	Ubufakazi be-phylogenetic bubonise ukuthi kokubili i-HCoV-NL63 kanye ne-HCoV-229E kungenzeka ukuthi kwaqala kuma-CoV elulwane, kuyilapho amagciwane angumzali e-HCoV-OC43 kanye ne-HCoV-HKU1 etholwe kumagundane.	Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were derived from mice.
609	en	zu	It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.	Kubikwe ukuthi i-CoV yelulwane ebizwa ngokuthi i-ARCoV.2 (i-Appalachian Ridge CoV) etholwe elulwaneni elinemibala emithathu laseNyakatho Melika yabonisa ubudlelwano obuseduze ne-HCoV-NL63.	It has been reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the North American three-colored bat showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
610	en	zu	On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, i-HCoV-229E yayihlobene ngokwezakhi zofuzo nenye i-CoV yelulwane, ebizwa ngokuthi i-Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, eyatholwa e-Ghana, kuyilapho ama-camelid aye asolwa ngokuba umbungazi wayo oseduze.	On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camelids have been suspected to be its closest host.
611	en	zu	For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2.	Ukuze sicacise, ulwazi lwamanje oluphathelene nemisuka eyizilwane yama-HCoV aziwayo lufinyezwe Kumfanekiso ​1 kanye Nethebula 2.	For clarity, current information regarding the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​ Figure1 1 and Table ​ Table2.
612	en	zu	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.	Ukuhlaziywa kwe-phylogenetic kunikeze ubufakazi bezigameko zokuthelelana kwezidalwa zama-HCoV emlandweni.	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of historical HCoV transmission events.
613	en	zu	When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.	Ngenkathi i-HCoV-OC43 isuka kwesinye isilwane ukuze idluliselwe kubantu yasuka ezilwaneni ezifuywayo cishe ngo-1890, kwaqoshwa ubhubhane lwesifo sokuphefumula .	When HCoV-OC43 was transferred from one animal to humans and from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory disease was recorded.
614	en	zu	The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.	Umlando wokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezihlukahlukene we-HCoV-229E awucacile kakhulu.	The cross-species history of HCoV-229E is very unclear.
615	en	zu	Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.	Kutholwe ama-alpha-CoV elulwane ahlobenene-HCoV-229E.	Bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E have been detected.
616	en	zu	Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.	Phakathi kwawo kukhona i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca.	Among them is the alpha-CoV of the alpaca.
617	en	zu	Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.	Ubufakazi obumbalwa busekela ukudluliswa kwegciwane lisuka emalulwaneni liye kubantu ngokuqondile.	Few lines of evidence support direct transmission from bats to humans.
618	en	zu	First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.	Okokuqala, abantu hhayi ama-alpaca kungenzeka ukuthi baxhumane namalulwane endaweni ezungezile efanayo.	First, humans and not alpacas are likely to interact with bats in the same environment.
619	en	zu	Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.	Kunalokho, abantu abasondelana ngokuseduze nama-alpaca.	Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
620	en	zu	Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.	Okwesibili, ama-alpha-CoV elulwane ahlobene ne-HCoV-229E ahlukahlukene futhi awakubangeli ukugula kumalulwane, kuyilapho i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca yabangela ukubheduka kwesifo sokuphefumula kuzilwane ezithelelekile.	Second, the bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are heterogeneous and do not cause disease in bats, while the alpaca alpha-CoV caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
621	en	zu	Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.	Okugcina, i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca ayikatholwa kuzilwane zasendle.	Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wild animals.
622	en	zu	Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.	Ngenxa yalokho, ngeke silishalazele ithuba lokuthi ama-alpaca athola i-alpha-CoV ehlobene ne-HCoV-229E kubantu.	As a result, we cannot rule out the possibility that alpacas acquire an alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans.
623	en	zu	In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.	Eqinisweni, amalulwane awumthombo oqondile wamagciwane abangela ukugula kwabantu okuhlanganisa igciwane lamarabi, igciwane le-Ebola, igciwane le-Nipah kanye negciwane le-Hendra.	In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that cause human illness including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
624	en	zu	It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.	Ngakho akumangalisi ukuthi amalulwane kungenzeka adlulisele i-HCoV-229E kubantu ngokuqondile.	It is therefore not surprising that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
625	en	zu	Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, lapho ama-alpha-CoV elulwane esebenza njengeqoqo lezakhi zofuzo ze-HCoV-229E, ama-alpaca kanye namakamela e-dromedary kungenzeka ukuthi angumbungazi omaphakathi odlulisela igciwane kubantu, njengoba kunjalo nge-MERS-CoV.	On the other hand, where bat alpha-CoVs serve as a genetic cluster for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels are likely to be the intermediate host for human transmission, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
626	en	zu	MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.	I-MERS-CoV iyisibonelo esihle sokuthelelana kwezidalwa ezingafani kusukela kumalulwane kuye kumakamela e-dromedary kuye kubantu.	MERS-CoV is a good example of cross-species transmission from bats to dromedary camels to humans.
627	en	zu	The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.	Umsuka wokuziphendukela kwe-MERS-CoV evela kumalulwane uyaziwa ekuhlonzweni kwayo kokuqala futhi uqiniswe ngokutholiwe okulandelayo.	The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial identification and has been confirmed by subsequent discoveries.
628	en	zu	It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.	Kusobala ukuthi amalulwane anikeza izinhlobonhlobo zamagciwane ithuba lokuthi kube nokushintshana kwezingxenye zezakhi zofuzo phakathi kwezilwane ezihlukene kanye nokuthelelana kwezilwane ezihlukene.	It is clear that bats provide an opportunity for a variety of pathogens to exchange genetic components between different animals and infect different animals.
629	en	zu	Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'.	Impilo ende, amakoloni aminyene, ukusondelana komphakathi okuseduze kanye nekhono elinamandla lokundiza konke kuyizimo ezikahle zokuthi amalulwane abe 'umbhebhethekisi wegciwane' okahle.	Long lives, dense colonies, close social proximity and a strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats to be an ideal &#39;virus spreader&#39;.
630	en	zu	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, sekungamakhulu eminyaka i-MERS-CoV yethulwe kumakamela e-dromedary.	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for centuries.
631	en	zu	It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.	Ivumelaniseke kahle kulawa makamela aphenduke ekubeni umbungazi omaphakathi aba umbungazi ozinzile nongumthombo ongokwemvelo.	It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host into a stable host and a natural resource.
632	en	zu	MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.	I-MERS-CoV ibangela ukugula okuncane futhi inezinga lokushintsha eliphansi kulezi zilwane.	MERS-CoV causes less disease and has a low mutation rate in these animals.
633	en	zu	Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.	Ukutheleleka kwayo kubantu kuyiphutha futhi abantu bahlala bengumbungazi wokugcina we-MERS-CoV njengoba ukudluliswa kwayo kungakwazi ukulondolozwa.	Its transmission to humans is erratic and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be maintained.

Isibonelo sale miphumela siwukulahleka kwe-ORF4 enobude obuphelele kuhlobo lwephrothothayiphu ethi HCoV-229E, ngenxa yokususwa kwe-nucleotide ekabili.	An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to a double nucleotide deletion.
700	en	zu	While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.	Nakuba i-ORF4 ephelele yabonwa kumagciwane elulwane nekamela ahlobene ne-HCoV-229E, i-alpha-CoV ye-alpaca ibonisa ukufakwa kwe-nucleotide eyodwa, okuholela ekushintsheni kwefreyimu.	While the complete ORF4 was observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame shift.
701	en	zu	Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.	Okokugcina kodwa okubalulekile, ukuziphendukela kwama-HCoV amasha kuphinde kuqhutshwe ingcindezi yokukhethwa kubabungazi bayo abawumthombo.	Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their source hosts.
702	en	zu	Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.	Zazingekho izimpawu noma kwakunezimpawu ezincane kuphela ezitholiwe lapho amalulwane etheleleka ngama-CoV, okubonisa ukuvumelaniswa okufanayo phakathi kwama-CoV namalulwane.	No symptoms or only minor symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a similar interaction between CoVs and bats.
703	en	zu	It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.	Kubonakala sengathi amalulwane avumelaniswe kahle nama-CoV ngokwesakhiwo nendlela yokusebenza.	Bats appear to be well adapted to CoVs structurally and functionally.
704	en	zu	For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.	Ngokwesibonelo, ukuphazamiseka kokusetshenziswa kokusabela okukhuthaza ukuvuvukala kumalulwane kuyinciphisa kalula i-pathology eqaliswa ama-CoV.	For example, disruption of the pro-inflammatory response in bats easily reduces the pathology induced by CoVs.
705	en	zu	Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.	Ngaphandle kwalokho, umsebenzi weseli elingumbulali ongokwemvelo kumalulwane uyacindezelwa ngenxa yokwenyuka kokusabela kwesivimbi sesisabeli seseli elingumbulali ongokwemvelo elithi NKG2/CD94 kanye nezinga lokuboniswa eliphansi lamangqamuzana esigaba I esiyinkimbinkimbi se-histocompatibility.	Additionally, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increased reactivity of the natural killer cell receptor inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of class I histocompatibility complex cells.
706	en	zu	Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, izinga eliphakeme lezidalwa ezisabela kumoya-mpilo (i-ROS) ezakhiwe ngomsebenzi wokugaywa kokudla okuphakeme kwamalulwane kungase kuthinte kokubili ukucindezelwa kokuphindwa kwe-CoV futhi kuthinte ukuhlolwa kwamaphutha nge-exoribonuclease, ngaleyo ndlela kunikeza ingcindezi yokukhethwa yokwakhiwa kwezinhlobo zegciwane ezi-pathogenic kakhulu lapho zethulwa kumbungazi omusha.	In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high digestive activity of bats may affect both the suppression of CoV replication and affect the evaluation of errors by exoribonuclease, thus providing a selection pressure for the creation of more pathogenic virus strains where introduced to the new host.
707	en	zu	More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.	Izinhlobo ze-CoV ezi-pathogenic kakhulu zingase futhi zishintshe ngokuhlanganiswa kabusha, okuholela ekutholweni kwamaphrotheni amasha noma izici zephrotheni zokuvumelaniswa kombungazi.	Highly pathogenic CoV strains may also change by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
708	en	zu	Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.	Ngenxa yalokho, akuyona nje inhlanhla ukuthi ama-HCoV amasha amathathu avele emashumini amabili eminyaka edlule.	Consequently, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
709	en	zu	CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.	Ama-CoV awagulisani noma abangele izimpawu ezincane kubabungazi bawo abayinhloko njengamalulwane namakamela.	CoVs do not infect or cause mild symptoms in their primary hosts such as bats and camels.
710	en	zu	They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.	Aphindeka ngokushesha ngaphandle kokukhuthaza ukusabela okuqinile kwamasosha omzimba.	They recur quickly without stimulating a strong immune response.
711	en	zu	Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.	Lapha kunezimfihlo zokuthi kungani izithwali ezingenazo izimpawu zibonwa nokuthi yini ebangela izimo ezibucayi ekuguleni kwabantu.	Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes critical conditions in human illness.
712	en	zu	The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.	Izimpawu ezibucayi ngokuyinhloko zibangelwa ukusebenza kakhulu kwamasosha omzimba kanye nesiphepho se-cytokine lapho kunokusabela kwamasosha omzimba okuqinile, umonakalo wamaphaphu uba mkhulu kakhulu.	Acute symptoms are mainly caused by overactive immune system and cytokine storm where there is a strong immune response, lung damage is more severe.
713	en	zu	In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.	Ngokuhlukile, kulabo abangazibonisi izimpawu zokugula, ukusabela kwamasosha omzimba kuye kwahlukaniswa kabili ekuphindweni kwe-CoV.	In contrast, in those who do not show symptoms of illness, the immune response has been divided in two to CoV replication.
714	en	zu	The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.	Isu elifanayo lokuhlukanisa ukusabela kwamasosha omzimba lingase libe nemiphumela ezuzisayo ekwelashweni okumelene ne-SARS-CoV-2.	A similar strategy to modulate the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
715	en	zu	The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.	Ukusabela kwe-interferon kuqine ngokukhethekile kumalulwane.	The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
716	en	zu	Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.	Ngenxa yalokho, ukusetshenziswa kohlobo I lwe-interferon okungenani ezigabeni zokuqala zokutheleleka nge-SARS-CoV-2 kubantu kufanele kuzuzise.	Consequently, the use of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
717	en	zu	In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.	Ngaphezu kwalokho, ukusetshenziswa kwe-NLRP3 inflammasome kumalulwane akusebenzi.	Furthermore, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is inactive.
718	en	zu	By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.	Ngokwalokhu kucabanga, ukuvinjwa kwe-NLRP3 inflammasome nge-MCC950 kungase kube usizo ekwelashweni kwe-COVID-19.	According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
719	en	zu	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.	Ukuvela kwe-SARS-CoV-2 kulandela itimu evamile yokuvela kwe-SARS-CoV kanye ne-MERS-CoV.	The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme of the evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
720	en	zu	Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.	Nakuba kutholwe i-beta-CoV yelulwane eyabelana ngo-95% we-nucleotide homology ne-SARS-CoV, kukhona futhi i-CoV yelulwane eyabelana ngo-96% we-nucleotide homology ne-SARS-CoV-2.	While a bat beta-CoV has been found that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
721	en	zu	Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.	Nakuba ama-civet nezinye izilwane ezimakethe kutholwe ukuthi zifukamela amagciwane afana ne-SARS-CoV, ababungazi abamaphakathi abaseduze be-SARS-CoV-2 abakatholwa.	Although civets and other market animals have been found to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
722	en	zu	Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.	Kutholwe ama-beta-CoV e-pangolin anesakhiwo esifanayo ne-SARS-CoV-2, okubonisa ukuthi ama-pangolin kungenzeka ukuthi angabanye ababungazi abamaphakathi noma ama-beta-CoV ama-pangolin angase abe nesandla ezingxenyeni zezakhi zofuzo enguqulweni yokugcina ye-SARS-CoV-2.	Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to have the same structure as SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins may be other intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to genetic components in the final version of SARS- CoV-2.
723	en	zu	Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.	Yize imibuzo isamile, abukho ubufakazi bokuthi i-SARS-CoV-2 yakhiwe umuntu ngenhloso noma ngephutha.	Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by man on purpose or by mistake.
724	en	zu	CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.	Ama-CoV abuyele eshashalazini ngenxa yokubheduka kwakamuva kwe-SARS-CoV-2.	CoVs have returned to the theater due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
725	en	zu	The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.	Ukucwaningwa kwama-CoV emalulwaneni nezinye izilwane kuwushintshe kakhulu umbono wethu wokubaluleka kwemisuka ye-zoonotic nemithombo eyizilwane yama-HCoV ekuthelelaneni kwabantu.	The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal sources of HCoVs in human infection.
726	en	zu	Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.	Ubufakazi obusakazekile bubonisa ukuthi i-SARS-CoV, i-MERS-CoV kanye ne-SARS-CoV-2 inomsuka oyilulwane futhi idluliselwa kubantu ngababungazi abamaphakathi.	Anecdotal evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of bat origin and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
727	en	zu	Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.	Njengoba ukutheleleka nge-SARS-CoV kusuka ekuthintaneni okuphakathi kwabantu nama-civet ezimakethe, ukuvala izimakethe zezilwane eziphilayo nokubulala ama-civet kwakungase kuqede umqedazwe we-SARS.	Since SARS-CoV infection came from direct contact between humans and civets in markets, closing down live animal markets and killing civets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
728	en	zu	By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.	Ngokucabanga okufanayo, ama-pangolin kufanele akhishwe ezimakethe ezidayisa izinto eziphilayo ukuze kuvinjelwe ukutheleleka oku-zoonotic, kucatshangelwa ukutholwa kwezinhlu eziningi zama-beta-CoV e-pangolin ahlobene ngokuseduze ne-SARS-CoV-2.	By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from organic markets to prevent zoonotic infection, considering the discovery of multiple beta-CoV strains in pangolin closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
729	en	zu	However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.	Nokho, ukuthi iyadluliselwa yini nokuthi idluliselwa kanjani i-SARS-CoV-2 kubantu ngama-pangolin nezinye izilwane ezincelisayo kusazocaciswa ezingcwaningweni zesikhathi esizayo.	However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined in future studies.
730	en	zu	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.	Ngakolunye uhlangothi, i-MERS-CoV ibilokhu ikhona kumakamela e-dromedary isikhathi eside.	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
731	en	zu	These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.	Lawa makamela ayithuluzi elibalulekile lezokuthutha kanye nomthombo oyinhloko wenyama, ubusi, isikhumba nemikhiqizo kavolo kubantu basendaweni.	These camels are an important means of transport and the main source of meat, honey, leather and wool products for the local people.
732	en	zu	They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.	Asakazeke kabanzi e-Middle East nase-Africa.	Widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
733	en	zu	It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.	Ngakho kuyinto engenakwenzeka ukuthi kubulawe wonke amakamela ukuze kulawulwe i-MERS, njengoba kwenzeka ezimakethe zezilwane zasendle e-China ukuze kuvinjwe ukusakazeka kwe-SARS-CoV ne-SARS-CoV-2.	So it is impossible to kill all the camels to control MERS, as is happening in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
734	en	zu	To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.	Ukuze kuvinjwe ukubheduka okuphindayo kwe-MERS, kufanele kusetshenziswe indlela eningilizayo ukuze kwakhiwe imigomo esebenzayo emelene ne-MERS-CoV yamakamela, ehambisana nezinye izinyathelo zokulawula isifo.	In order to prevent the re-emergence of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be used to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other disease control measures.
735	en	zu	As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks.	Njengoba singakwazi ukuqeda lawa magciwane, ama-genotype amasha angase avele ukuze abangele ukubheduka.	Since we cannot eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
736	en	zu	A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.	Izinhlobonhlobo zama-CoV a-zoonotic ziyajikeleza ehlane.	A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.

738	en	zu	There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future.	Kukhona amathuba amaningi okuthi lawa ma-CoV e-zoonotic ashintshe futhi ahlangane kabusha, okuzophumela kuma-CoV amasha akwazi ukuthelelana kakhulu kanye/noma abulale abantu esikhathini esizayo.	There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will mutate and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that can become more infectious and/or lethal to humans in the future.
739	en	zu	The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.	Isiko lokudla izilwane zasendle kwezinye izindawo zase-China kufanele liyekwe ukuze kuncishiswe ukuxhumana okungadingekile phakathi kwabantu nezilwane.	The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
740	en	zu	With the ordeals of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.	Ngezigameko ze-SARS, i-MERS kanye ne-COVID-19, kufanele kube khona uhlelo lokulungela nokusabela olungcono kakhulu.	With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 incidents, there must be a better preparedness and response plan.
741	en	zu	In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time.	Empeleni, amagciwane amaningi anesikhathi eside ekhona emhlabeni.	In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
742	en	zu	They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.	Ahlala ezindaweni zawo ezingokwemvelo kuze kube yilapho ethola ithuba lokuphuma.	They stay in their natural habitats until they get a chance to get out.
743	en	zu	Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.	Nakuba amalulwane enezici eziningi ezikhuthaza ukusakazwa kwamagciwane, ithuba lokuthi abantu baxhumane namalulwane nezinye izilwane zasendle angacishiswa uma abantu befundiswa ukuthi baqhele kuzona.	Although bats have many characteristics that promote the transmission of pathogens, the opportunity for people to come into contact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are taught to stay away from them.
744	en	zu	Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.

Availability of medical supplies and socio-economic factors of the region can contribute to mortality.
2011	en	zu	Estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.	Izilinganiso zokufa kwabantu ngenxa yegciwane ziyahlukahluka ngenxa yalowo mehluko ezifundeni, kodwa nangenxa yobunzima ezindleleni ezisetshenziswayo.	Estimates of deaths from the virus vary because of that difference in regions, but also because of the difficulties in the methods used.
2012	en	zu	The under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.	Ukuba mbalwa kwezimo ezingezimbi kakhulu kungabangela isilinganiso sabafayo sibe ngaphezu kokulindelekile.	Fewer less severe cases can cause the death rate to be higher than expected.
2013	en	zu	However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.	Nokho, iqiniso lokuthi ukufa kungumphumela wezigameko zabathole igciwane ngokwedlule lingasho ukuthi isilinganiso sabantu abafayo manje siphansi.	However, the fact that deaths are the result of past infections may mean that the current death rate is low.
2014	en	zu	Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
