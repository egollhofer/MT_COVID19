Utafiti uliofanywa 2010-11 ulionyesha tofauti kubwa katika upatikanaji wa vitanda vya matibabu ya hali mahututi na ya wastani barani Ulaya, kuanzia 29.2 nchini Ujerumani hadi vitanda 4.2 kwa kila idadi ya watu 100,000 nchini Ureno.	A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a large difference in the availability of acute and moderate treatment beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
139	en	sw	This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).	Hii inamaanisha kwamba nchi zinaweza kuwa na rasilimali chache au nyingi kuliko Italia (vitanda vya kulaza watu walio katika hali mahututi na matibabu ya wastani 12.5 kwa kila idadi 100,000 mwaka 2010-11).	This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (intensive care beds and treatment on average 12.5 per 100,000 population in 2010-11).

141	en	sw	Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.	Kwa vile visa kwa sasa vimejumuishwa katika maeneo fulani katika nchi za EU/EEA na Uingereza, na hospitali na vitengo vya kushughulikia watu walio katika hali mahututi kikawaida huduma eneo la idadi maalum, taarifa kuhusu visa na vitanda vya kulazwa kwa watu walio katika hali mahututi inapaswa kupatikana katika vitengo vya kihimaya vya Kutoa majina kwa ajili ya takwimu ya kiwango cha 2 (NUTS-2).	As visas are currently included in certain areas in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units normally service a limited number of areas, information on visas and intensive care beds should found in Nomenclature units for statistics level 2 (NUTS-2).
142	en	sw	The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.	Hali iliyopo nchini Italia na masuala yanayoendelea sasa katika nchi nyingine yanaonyesha kwamba janga kubwa la COVID-19 linaongezeka kwa kasi katika EU/EEA na Uingereza.	The situation in Italy and the current issues in other countries show that the serious epidemic of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
143	en	sw	Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.	Nchi, hospitali na vitengo vya kushughulikia wagonjwa mahututi hivyo vinapaswa kujiandaa kwa hali ya kuendelea kwa maenezi ya kijumuiya ya SARS-CoV-2 na ongezeko la idadi ya wagonjwa wa COVID-19 wanaohitaji tiba na hasa matibatu ya watu walio katika hali mahututi, kama vile inayofanyika katika maeneo yaliyoathirika ya Italia.	Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need treatment and especially the treatment of people in critical condition, such as taking place in the affected areas of Italy.
144	en	sw	As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.	Kama ilivyodokezwa katika tathmini ya hivi majuzi ya hatari ya kasi ya ECDC, mwelekeo wa haraka, unaohusisha watu na tondoti ni muhimu katika kuchelewesha kuenea kwa SARS-COV-2, kukiwa na mabadiliko kutoka mtazamo wa kiudhibiti hadi wa kukabiliana, kwa vile ongezeko linalotarajiwa la idadi ya visa huenda lisiwape wafanya maamuzi na hospitali muda wa kutosha kuelewa, kukubali na kuweka mikakati yao ya kukabiliana ipasavyo wasipotekeleza ipasavyo mapema.	As indicated in ECDC&#39;s recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, human-centered approach is critical to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a regulatory to a response approach, as the expected increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and set their response strategies properly if they do not implement them early.
145	en	sw	The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.	Tathmini ya hatari ya haraka pia inaorodhesha hatua za afya ya umma ili kukabiliana na athari za janga kubwa.	The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to deal with the effects of a major disaster.
146	en	sw	There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.	Kuna nafasi ndogo ya fursa ambapo nchi zina uwezo wa kuongeza jitihada zao za udhibiti ili kupunguza kuenea kwa SARS-CoV-2 na kupunguza shinikizo kwenye matibabu.

As high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs were widely used in severe SARS patients, many of the victims suffered from lack of blood in the bones and long-term disability and poor quality of life.
360	en	sw	Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.	Hivyo, ikihitajika, steroids zinapaswa kutumika kwa dozi ya chini na kwa muda mfupi kwa wagonjwa wa COVID-19.	Thus, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in patients with COVID-19.

Kwa hivyo, tahadhari kubwa inapaswa kuchukuliwa ili kuwalinda binadamu, hasa watoa huduma ya afya, wafanyakazi wa jamii, wanafamilia, wafanyakazi wenza na hata watu wengine wanaowagusa wagonjwa au watu walioambukizwa.	Therefore, great care should be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers and even other people who come into contact with sick or infected people.
384	en	sw	The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.	Hatua ya kwanza ya kujikinga inayoweza kutumika kupunguza hatari ya maambukizi ni kupitia kuvaa barakao za uso; kutumia barakoa za matibabu na barakoa za N95 za kusaidia pumu (matoleo ya # 1860) husaidia kudhibiti kuenea kwa virusi.	The first protective measure that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a face mask; using medical masks and N95 masks to support asthma (issues # 1860) helps control the spread of the virus.
385	en	sw	Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.	Barakoa za uso za kimatibabu zinazuia matone ya majimaji kutoka wa mtu anayeweza kuwa ameambukizwa dhidi ya kusafirishwa hewani au kukwama kwenye sehemu za bidhaa, ambapo yanaweza kupitisha kwa watu wengine.	Medical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from becoming airborne or stuck on product surfaces, where they can be passed on to other people.

Hata hivyo, barakoa za N95 pekee (matoleo ya # 1860) zinaweza kulinda dhidi ya kupumua ndani viini vidogo hata kwa vipimo vya 10 hadi 80 nm, huku 5% ya viini hivyo vikiweza kupenyeza kikamilifu; SARS-CoV-2 ni sawa na SARS-CoV kwa ukubwa na ni takriban 85 nm.	However, only N95 masks (issue # 1860) can protect against inhalation of small particles even with dimensions of 10 to 80 nm, with 5% of those particles being able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is approximately 85 nm.
387	en	sw	Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.	Kwa vile vipande vidogo vinaweza kupenyeza hata barakoa tano zilizowekwa pamoja, watoa huduma ya afya wanaogusana na wagonjwa lazima wavae barakoa za N95 (matoleo ya # 1860) lakini sio barakoa za kimatibabu.	Since the particles can penetrate as many as five masks stacked together, healthcare providers who come into contact with patients must wear N95 masks (#1860 versions) but not medical masks.
388	en	sw	In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.	Pamoja na barakoa, watoa huduma ya afya wanapaswa kuvaa magwanda yenye vipengele hitajika ili kupuguza zaidi mgusano na virusi.	Along with masks, health care providers should wear protective clothing to further reduce exposure to the virus.

Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoV viruses that are circulating in the community (ie. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
525	en	sw	On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.	Kwa upande mmoja, maambukizi ya SARS-CoV-2 huonyesha sifa ambazo kwa kawaida huonekana wakati wa maambukizi ya virusi vya kuambukizana kijamii vya HCoV, ikiwa ni pamoja na kuonyesha dalili zisizo mahususi, kiasi au hata kutokuwepo kwa dalili zozote.	On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are usually seen during the infection of the highly contagious HCoV virus, including showing non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
526	en	sw	On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.	Kwa upande mwingine, kijikundi kidogo cha visa kali vya COVID-19 pia kinaweza kuonekana kama ilivyo katika kisa cha maambukizi ya SARS-CoV, ingawa vipimo ni vya chini zaidi.	On the other hand, a small group of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the doses are much lower.

Kwa upande mmoja, uwezo wa kusambazwa kwa SARS-CoV-2 angalau uko juu kama ule wa virusi vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii.	On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the socially transmitted HCoV virus.

Pia ni jambo la kuvutia kuona iwapo virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vinaweza kutokea kwa misimu kama ilivyo katika visa vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii.	It is also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 viruses can occur seasonally as in the case of socially transmitted HCoV cases.
533	en	sw	Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.	Licha ya hayo, vipengele vya SARS-CoV-2 ikiwa ni pamoja na uwezo wa kusambazwa, uwezo wa kuambukiza na kuendelea kusambaa baada ya kupitishwa kwa binadamu vitakuwa na ushawishi kwenye hatima ya mkurupuko unaoendelea wa COVID-19.

535	en	sw	From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.	Kwa mtazamo mwingine, pia huenda ikawa ni ukweli kwamba binadamu wamezoea virusi hivi vinne vya HCoV.	From another point of view, it may also be the fact that humans have adapted to these four HCoV viruses.
536	en	sw	In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.	Yaani, huenda wote wakawa wasaliaji wa majanga ya zamani ya HCoV.	That is, they may all be survivors of past HCoV epidemics.
537	en	sw	HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.	Virusi vya HCoV vinavyosababisha magonjwa kali kwa binadamu na binadamu waliopata magonjwa kali ya HCoV wameondolewa.	HCoV viruses that cause severe disease in humans and humans who have developed severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
538	en	sw	For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.	Ndio hii ifanyike, virusi vya HCoV lazima vizalishwe ndani ya binadamu kwa kiwango toshelevu cha kuruhusu mkusanyiko wa mabadiliko yanayoweza kupambana na vigezo vya udhibiti vya mbebaji virusi.	For this to happen, the HCoV virus must be reproduced in humans at a level sufficient to allow the accumulation of mutations that can counteract the host&#39;s regulatory parameters.
539	en	sw	In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.	Kwa mantiki hii, kadri mkurupuko wa SARS-CoV-2 unavyondelea na jinsi watu zaidi wanavyoambukizwa, ndivyo kuna uwezekano mkuu kwamba utazoeleka kwa binadamu.	In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 continues and the more people are infected, the higher the probability that it will become human.
540	en	sw	If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.	Ikiwa virusi hivi vitazoeleka vyema, uenezi wake kwa binadamu unaweza kuwa vigumu kudhibiti kupitia karantini au hatua zingine za kudhibiti maambukizi.	If this virus adapts well, its spread to humans may be difficult to control through quarantine or other infection control measures.
541	en	sw	For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.	Kwa miaka mingi, virusi vinne vya CoV vinavyoenezwa kijamii vimesambaa miongoni mwa watu, na kuchochea homa ya kawaida miongoni mwa watu/wanyama walio na kinga thabiti.	Over the years, four socially transmitted CoV viruses have spread among people, causing common colds among people/animals with stable immunity.
542	en	sw	These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.	Virusi hivi havihitaji hifadhi ndani ya mnyama.	This virus does not need to be harbored in the animal.
543	en	sw	In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.	Kinyume chake, virusi vya SARS-CoV na MERS-CoV ambavyo husambazwa zaidi havijazoeleka vyema kwa binadamu na uenezi wake miongoni mwa binadamu hauwezi kudhibitiwa.	In contrast, the more widely distributed SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses are poorly adapted to humans and their spread among humans cannot be controlled.
544	en	sw	They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.	Vinahitaji kudumisha na kuendeleza hifadhi zao ndani ya wanyama na kutafuta nafasi ya kusambaa kwa wanadamu wanaolengwa walio hatarini, pengine kupitia kibebaji cha pili na kinachoeneza.	They need to maintain and develop their reservoirs in animals and find a way to spread to vulnerable human targets, probably through a secondary and spreading carrier.
545	en	sw	SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.	Virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vina sifa sawa na za virusi vya SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV na HCoV nne vinavyosambazwa kijamii.	The SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same characteristics as the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV virus and the four socially transmitted HCoVs.

547	en	sw	However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.	Hata hivyo, inasababisha ugonjwa kuliko virusi vya HCoV vinavyosambazwa kijamii na uwezo wake wa kusababisha ugonjwa ni wa chini kuliko SARS-CoV au MERS-CoV.	However, it is more pathogenic than the socially transmitted HCoV virus and its pathogenicity is lower than that of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
548	en	sw	It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.	Itasalia kuonekana iwapo vitazoeleka kikamilifu kwa binadamu na kusambaa ndani ya binadamu bila hifadhi au mnyama mbebaji.	It remains to be seen whether they will fully adapt to humans and spread within humans without a reservoir or carrier animal.
549	en	sw	Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.	Kabla ya kujadili asili zinazotokana na wanyama za HCoV, itakuwa vyema kwetu kujadili ufafanuzi na sifa za kibebaji cha kiukuaji, asilia,hifadhi na mbebaji wa uenezi wa HCoV.	Before discussing the animal-derived origins of HCoV, it would be useful for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the developmental, natural, reservoir and dissemination carrier of HCoV.
550	en	sw	An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.	Mnyama hutumika kama kibebaji cha HCoV cha kiukuaji ikiwa amehifadhi ukoo wa karibu unaofanana katika kiwango cha mfululizo wa nukliotidi.	An animal serves as a developmental HCoV carrier if it has retained a closely related lineage at the nucleotide sequence level.
551	en	sw	The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.	Virusi vya kiukoo kwa kawaida vimezoeleka na havina uwezo wa kusababisha ugonjwa ndani ya mbebaji huyu.	Herd viruses are usually endemic and are not capable of causing disease in this carrier.
552	en	sw	Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.	Vilevile, mbebaji ambaye ni hifadhi huwa na HCoV kila mara na kwa muda mrefu.	Likewise, a reservoir carrier is always and chronically infected with HCoV.
553	en	sw	In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.	Katika hali zote, vibebaji virusi huambukizwa kiasilia na ni wabebaji asili wa HCoV au virusi vyake ambavyo ni vizazi.	In all cases, the virus carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its progeny viruses.
554	en	sw	In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.	Kinyume chake, ikiwa virusi vya HCoV vimeingia kwa mara ya kwanza ndani ya mbebaji wa kati kabla au karibu kuingia kwake kwa binadamu, huwa havijazoeleka vyema katika mazingira hayo mapya na mara nyingi husababisha ugonjwa.	Conversely, if HCoV has first entered an intermediate host before or near its entry into humans, it does not adapt well to the new environment and often causes disease.
555	en	sw	This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.	Mbebaji huyu wa kati anaweza kutumika kama chanzo kutokana na wanyama cha maambukizi kwa binadamu na hutekeleza jukumu la mbebaji msambazaji kwa kuruhusu virusi kuzalishwa na kisha kusambazwa kwa binadamu ili kuzidisha kiwango cha maambukizi kwa binadamu.	This intermediate carrier can serve as a source of infection from animals to humans and plays the role of a transmitting carrier by allowing the virus to be produced and then transmitted to humans to increase the level of infection in humans.
556	en	sw	An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.	Virusi vya HCoV vinaweza kupitia maambukizi yasiyo na athari ikiwa haviwezi kudumisha usambazaji wake ndani ya mbebaji wa kati.	HCoV viruses can undergo passive transmission if they cannot maintain their transmission within an intermediate carrier.
557	en	sw	On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.	Kwa upande mwingine, virusi vya HCoV vinaweza pia kuzoeleka ndani ya mbebaji wake wa kati na hata kuunda hali ya ugonjwa wa muda mrefu.	On the other hand, the HCoV virus can also adapt within its intermediate carrier and even create a chronic disease state.
558	en	sw	In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.	Katika hali hii, mbebaji wa kati anakuwa mbebaji asilia anayehifadhi virusi.	In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural carrier harboring the virus.

Uchunguzi uliofuata wa kiwango cha maambukizi uliashiria kuwa wafanyabiashara ya wanyama walikuwa na kiwango cha juu cha anti-SARS-CoV igG ikilinganishwa na idadi ya jumla ya watu.	Subsequent prevalence studies indicated that animal traders had a higher level of anti-SARS-CoV igG compared to the general population.

Mask-faced raccoons (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that closely resembles SARS-CoV.
562	en	sw	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.	Hii iliungwa mkono kwa njia isiyo ya moja kwa moja na ukweli kwamba hakuna visa zaidi vya SARS vilvyoripotiwa baada ya kuuawa kwa ngawa wote waliokuwa sokoni.	This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were reported after the slaughter of all the pigs in the market.
563	en	sw	However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.	Hata hivyo, imeripotiwa kwamba ngawa wenye uso wenye barakoa kutoka porini au mashambani bila kutangamana na wanyama wanaouzwa sokoni wengi wao hawakupatikana na SARS-CoV, na kuashiria kwamba ngawa wenye uso wa barakao wanaweza tu kutumika kama wabebaji wa kati wa kueneza lakini sio hifadhi asili wa SARS-CoV.	However, it has been reported that masked manatees from the wild or farms without interacting with marketed animals were mostly free of SARS-CoV, indicating that manatee may only serve as intermediate carriers but not natural reservoirs of the virus. SARS-CoV.
564	en	sw	Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.	Itabainika kwamba, kwa vile 80% ya wanyama tofauti katika masoko ya Guangzhou wana antibodi zinazopambana na SARS-CoV, uwezekano kwamba aina nyingi za mamalia wadogo pia wanaweza kutumika kama wabebaji wa kati waenezi wa SARS-CoV hauwezi kupuuzwa.	It will be noted that, as 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that many types of small mammals can also serve as intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
565	en	sw	All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.	Hawa wote wanaonekana kuwa wabebaji wasio na athari wa SARS-CoV.	All of these appear to be unaffected carriers of SARS-CoV.
566	en	sw	Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.	Utafutaji uliofuata wa mnyama ambaye ni mbebaji asili wa SARS-CoV ulionyesha kuwa virusi vya CoV vinavyohusiana kwa karibu na popo, viitwavyo SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), vinavyopatikana ndani ya popo wa Kichina wa horsehoe.	A subsequent search for an animal that is a natural carrier of SARS-CoV revealed that a closely related bat CoV virus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), is found in Chinese horsehoe bats.

WIV1 virus isolated from a bat faecal sample was shown to use bat, mosquito and human ACE2 as a cell entry receptor.

To date, the WIV1 virus represents the closest lineage to SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
575	en	sw	Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.	Kwa mfanano mkubwa kati ya virusi hivi, inaaminika kwa jumla kwamba WIV1 si virusi vizalishaji vya kati vya SARS-CoV na popo sio wabebaji wa kati wanaohifadhi SARS-CoV.	Because of the great similarity between these viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the intermediate producer of SARS-CoV and bats are not the intermediate carriers harboring SARS-CoV.

Pia ni muhimu kukumbuka kwamba kwa kawaida dalili kiasi lakini zilizo na utoaji wa virusi kwa wingi kwa jumla zilionekana kwa ngamia walioambukizwa MERS-CoV kwa ajili ya majaribio.	It is also important to note that usually mild symptoms but with overall high viral shedding were observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV for testing.

Ni dhahiri kwamba, ngamia walioambukizwa hutoa virusi sio tu kupitia njia ya kupumua lakini pia kupitia kinyesi, ambayo pia ni njia kuu ya kutoa virusi kutoka kwa popo.	It is evident that, the infected camels release the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the feces, which is also the main way of releasing the virus from bats.
586	en	sw	However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.	Hata hivyo, maswali bado hayajajibiwa kwa kuwa visa vingi vya watu waliothibitishwa kuwa na MERS hawana historia ya kutangamana na ngamia kabla ya kuanza kwa dalili, na kuashiria pakubwa maambukizi ya binadamu hadi kwa binadamu au njia zisizojulikana za usambazaji zinazohusisha aina za wanyama ambao hawajatambuliwa wanaobeba MERS-CoV.

610	en	sw	On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.	Kwa upande mwingine, virusi vya HCoV-229E vilihusiana kigenetiki na virusi vingine vya bat CoV, vinavyoitwa Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, vilivyogunduliwa nchini Ghana, huku wanyama wadogo wa jamii ya ngamia pia wakishukiwa kuwa wabebaji wake wa kati.	On the other hand, the HCoV-229E virus was genetically related to another bat CoV virus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, while small camels are also suspected to be its intermediate carriers.
611	en	sw	For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2.	Kwa uwazi, maarifa ya sasa kuhusu asili ya wanyama ya virusi vya HCoV vinavyojulikana yamewekwa kwa njia ya muhtasari katika mchoro wa 1 na Jedwali la 2.	For clarity, the current knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoV viruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
612	en	sw	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.	Uchanganuzi wa kifilojenetiki umetoa ushahidi wa matukio ya usambazaji wa HCoV baina ya aina za wanyama katika historia.	Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV transmission events between animal species in history.
613	en	sw	When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.	Wakati virusi vya HCoV-OC43 vilisambaa baina ya wanyama na kuambukiza binadamu vikitoka kwa wanyama karibu mwaka wa1890, janga la maambukizi ya pumu lilishuhudiwa.	When the HCoV-OC43 virus spread between animals and infected humans from animals around 1890, an epidemic of asthma infection was witnessed.
614	en	sw	The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.	Historia ya usambazaji baina ya wanyama ya HCoV-229E si bayana.	The history of animal transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
615	en	sw	Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.	Virusi vya alpha-CoV vya popo vinavyohusiana kwa karibu na HCoV-229E vimepatikana.	A bat alpha-CoV virus closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
616	en	sw	Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.	Kati ya virusi hivyo kuna virusi vya alpha-CoV vinavyopatikana kwa alpaca ambaye ni aina ya mnyama.	Among those viruses there is the alpha-CoV virus found in alpaca which is a type of animal.
617	en	sw	Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.	Mistari kadhaa ya ushahidi huunga mkono usambazaji wa virusi wa moja kwa moja kutoka kwa popo hadi kwa binadamu.	Several lines of evidence support direct virus transmission from bats to humans.
618	en	sw	First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.	Kwanza, binadamu wala sio alpaca ambao ni wanyama huenda walikuwa na mgusano na popo katika mazingira walioshiriki ya kiekolojia.	First, humans and not alpacas who are animals may have had contact with bats in the ecological environment they shared.
619	en	sw	Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.	Badala yake, binadamu wanatangamana kwa karibu na alpaca ambao ni wanyama.	Instead, humans interact closely with alpacas who are animals.
620	en	sw	Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.	Pili, virusi vya alpha-CoVs vya popo vinavyohusiana na HCoV-229E ni tofauti na havina uwezo wa kusababisha ugonjwa ndani ya popo, ilhali virusi vya alpha-CoV vilivyopatikana kwa alpaca vilisababisha mkurupuko wa ugonjwa wa kupumua kwa wanyama walioambukizwa.	Second, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are different and do not cause disease in bats, whereas alpha-CoVs found in alpacas caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
621	en	sw	Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.	Mwisho, virusi vya alpha-CoV vilivyopatikana kwa alpaca havijapatikana ndani ya wanyama wa mwituni.	Finally, the alpha-CoV virus found in alpacas has not been found in wild animals.
622	en	sw	Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.	Hivyo, uwezekano wa alpaca kupata virusi vya alpha-CoV vinavyohusiana na HCoV-229E kutoka kwa binadamu hauwezi kufungiwa nje.	Thus, the possibility of alpacas acquiring an alpha-CoV virus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be excluded.
623	en	sw	In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.	Hakika, popo ndio chanzo cha moja kwa moja cha virusi vinavyosababisha ugonjwa kwa binadamu ikiwa ni pamoja na virusi vya kichaa cha mbwa, virusi vya Ebola, virusi vya Nipah na virusi vya Hendra.	Indeed, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
624	en	sw	It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.	Kwa hivyo si ajabu sana kwamba popo wana uwezo wa kusambaza HCoV-229E moja kwa moja kwa binadamu.	It is therefore not surprising that bats are capable of directly transmitting HCoV-229E to humans.
625	en	sw	Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.	Vinginevyo, ingawa virusi vya alpha-CoV vinatumika kama kikoa cha jeni cha HCoV-229E, alpaca na ngamia warefu zaidi huenda wanatumika kama wabebaji wa kati wa virusi wanaosambaza virusi kwa binadamu, hasa ilivyo katika hali ya MERS-CoV.	Alternatively, although the alpha-CoV virus serves as the genetic domain of HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels may serve as intermediate carriers of the virus that transmit the virus to humans, especially in the case of MERS-CoV.
626	en	sw	MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.	Virusi vya MERS-CoV vinatumika kama mfano bora wa usambazaji baina ya wanyama kutoka kwa popo hadi kwa ngamia warefu na kutoka kwa ngamia warefu hadi kwa binadamu.	The MERS-CoV virus serves as an excellent example of inter-animal transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
627	en	sw	The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.	Asili ya ukuaji ya MERS-CoV kutoka kwa popo inafahamika katika utambuzi wake wa kwanza na pia imethibitishwa na matokeo yaliyofuatia.	The origin of the development of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its first diagnosis and has also been confirmed by subsequent findings.
628	en	sw	It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.	Ni wazi kwamba popo hutoa mkusanyiko mkuu wa aina ya virusi kwa ajili ya mabadilishano baina ya wanyama ya visehemu za kijenetiki na usambazaji baina ya wanyama.	It is clear that bats provide a major reservoir of virus strains for inter-animal exchange of genetic material and inter-animal transmission.
629	en	sw	Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'.	Uwezo wa kuishi kwa muda mrefu, makazi yenye wanyama wengi, miingiliano ya karibu ya kijamii na uwezo thabiti wa kuruka ni hali zinazomfanya popo kuwa 'mnyama anayeweza kueneza virusi'.	The ability to live for a long time, densely populated habitats, close social interactions and robust flying abilities make bats a &#39;viral potential animal&#39;.
630	en	sw	On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.	Kwa upande mwingine, virusi vya MERS-CoV vimekuwa ndani ya ngamia warefu kwa muda wa miongo.	On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been inside camels for decades.
631	en	sw	It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.	Vilizoeleka vyema ndani ya ngamia hawa ambao wamegeuka kutoka kwa wabebaji wa kati wa virusi hadi kuwa wabebaji thabiti na asilia wanaohifadhi virusi.	It is well known in these camels that they have turned from intermediate carriers of the virus to stable and natural carriers of the virus.
632	en	sw	MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.	MERS-CoV husababisha ugonjwa kiasi sana na hudumisha kiwango cha chini cha kubadilika ikilinganishwa miongoni mwa wanyama hawa.	MERS-CoV is highly pathogenic and maintains a relatively low mutation rate among these animals.
633	en	sw	Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.	Usambazaji wake wa mara moja moja kwa binadamu ni ajali na binadamu wanasalia kuwa wabebaji wa mwisho wa MERS-CoV wasioambukizana kwa sababu usambazaji wake hauwezi kudumu.	Its one-time transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain the last non-infectious carriers of MERS-CoV because its transmission is not sustainable.
634	en	sw	In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.	Kinyume chake, jukumu la ngamia katika usambazaji wa MERS-CoV, jukumu la kakakuona, ikiwa kuna lolote, katika usambazaji wa SARS-CoV-2 ni tofauti.	In contrast, the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of armadillos, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
635	en	sw	Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.	Hususan, virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyopatikana kwa kakakuona vina uwezo mkubwa wa kusababisha magonjwa ndani ya kakakuona.	In particular, beta-CoV viruses found in armadillos are highly pathogenic within armadillos.
636	en	sw	They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.	Wanaweza kuwa ndio wabebaji virusi vya beta-CoV vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2- visivyoweza kuambukiza, sawa na ngawa katika hali ya SARS-CoV.	They may be non-infectious carriers of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to the virus in the case of SARS-CoV.
637	en	sw	Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.	Uwezekano kadhaa wa usambazaji wa SARS-CoV-2 baina ya viumbe kutoka kwa wanyama hadi kwa binadamu lazima uweze kukubalika au kukataliwa katika utafiti wa sku zijazo.	Several possibilities for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between organisms from animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in future studies.
638	en	sw	First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.	Kwanza, popo wanaweza kuwa wabebaji wahifadhi wa virusi vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 vinavyokaribia kufanana na SARS-CoV-2.	First, bats may be reservoir carriers of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that closely resemble SARS-CoV-2.
639	en	sw	Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.	Binadamu wanaweza kushiriki mazingira ya kiekolojia na popo kupitia uchinjaji au uchimbaji makaa ya mawe.	Humans can share the ecological environment with bats through butchery or coal mining.
640	en	sw	Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.	Pili, kakakuona wanaweza kuwa mojawapo ya wabebaji wa kati wanaosambaza virusi ambao wamepata virusi vinavyohusiana na SARS-CoV-2 kwa mara ya kwanza.	Second, armadillos may be one of the intermediate vectors that have acquired SARS-CoV-2-related viruses for the first time.
641	en	sw	Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.	Binadamu hupata virusi kupitia kuchinja na kula nyama ya wanyama wa porini.	Humans acquire the virus through slaughtering and eating the meat of wild animals.
642	en	sw	It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.	Kuna uwezekano kwamba mamalia wengi ikiwa ni pamoja na wanyama wa nyumbani wanaweza kupata SARS-CoV-2.	It is likely that many mammals including domestic animals can contract SARS-CoV-2.
643	en	sw	A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.	Uchunguzi wa wanyama wa nyumbani na wa porini kwa ajili ya antibodi unastahiki.	Testing of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is eligible.
644	en	sw	Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.	Tatu, kama ilivyotajwa hapa juu, kujumuishwa tena na kuzoeleka kwa SARS-CoV-2 huenda kulifanyika katika kiumbe cha tatu ambacho kilitangmana na popo na kakakuona.	Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third organism that interacted with bats and armadillos.
645	en	sw	The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.	Utafutaji wa sili ya SARS-CoV-2 kutoka kwa wanyama bado unaendelea.	The search for SARS-CoV-2 isolates from animals is still ongoing.
646	en	sw	Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.	Kando na aina tofauti za wanyama wabebaji, vigezo vitatu vikuu kwenye upande wa virusi pia ni muhimu katika kuwezesha virusi vya CoVs kusambazwa kwa viumbe.	In addition to the different types of animal carriers, three main parameters on the viral side are also important in enabling CoVs to be transmitted to organisms.
647	en	sw	First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.	Kwanza kabisa, viwango vyao vya juu vya kubadilika katika uzalishaji wa RNA.	First of all, their high levels of flexibility in RNA production.
648	en	sw	In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts.	Ikilinganisha na virusi vingine vya RNA moja, viwango vilivyokadiriwa vya kubadilika kwa CoV vinaweza kuzingatiwa kuwa “wastani” au “juu” huku kiwango cha wastani cha ubadilishanaji kikiwa ~10-4 kwa kila mwaka kwa kila eneo 2, kwa kutegemea awamu ya kuzoeleka kwa CoV kwenye mbebaji wake mpya.	Compared to other single RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoV can be considered “moderate” or “high” with an average mutation rate of ∼10-4 per year per region 2 , depending on the phase of CoV adaptation on its new carrier.
649	en	sw	CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.	Virusi vya CoVs vina eksoribonuklisi ya udurusu, ambayo kufutwa kwake husababisha kuongezeka kwa uwezo wa kubadilika, kupunguza athari au hata uwezo wake.	CoVs contain an exoribonuclease, whose deletion leads to increased mutagenicity, reduced effect or even potency.
650	en	sw	Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.	Jambo la kupendeza ni kuwa, dawa ya nucleotide analogue Remdesivir inafahamika kudidimisha uzalishaji wa CoV kupitia uzuiaji wa eksoribonuklisi na RNA polimerisi inayotegemea RNA.	Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue drug Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV production through inhibition of exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
651	en	sw	Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.	Remdesivir ni mojawapo ya chanjo iliyo na uwezo mkubwa dhidi ya SARS-CoV-2 iliyofanyiwa majaribio ya kimatibabu.	Remdesivir is one of the most potent vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that has undergone clinical trials.
652	en	sw	Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.	Licha ya hayo, viwango vya kubadilika kwa CoV ni takriban mara milioni zaidi ya vile vya wabebaji wake.	Despite this, the mutation rates of CoV are about a million times higher than those of its carriers.
653	en	sw	In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.	Pia, viwango vya kubadilika mara nyingi huwa juu wakati ambapo virusi vya CoV havijazoeleka kwenye mbebaji.	Also, mutation rates are often high when the CoV virus is not endemic in the carrier.
654	en	sw	Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.	Ikilinganishwa na virusi vya SARS-CoV vilivyo na viwango vya juu vya kubadilika, viwango vya kubadilika kwa SARS-CoV-2 ni bayana kuwa viko chini, hali inayoashiria uwezekano wa juu zaidi wa kuzoeleka kwa binadamu.	Compared to SARS-CoV viruses with high mutation rates, the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 are significantly lower, indicating a higher potential for human adaptation.
655	en	sw	Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.	Inaweza kuchukuliwa kwamba, tayari vimezoeleka kwa mbebaji mwingine wa karibu na binadamu.	It can be considered that, they are already familiar to another carrier close to humans.
656	en	sw	In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.	Pamoja na SARS-CoV-2, hii pia hutumika kwa MERS-CoV, virusi ambayo vimezoeleka vyema ndani ya ngamia warefu zaidi.	Along with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, a virus that is well-adapted to the tallest camels.
657	en	sw	Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.	Kinadharia, hakuna uwezekano kwamba mabadiliko ya kijenetiki yanaweza kufanya chanjo na dawa za kupambana na virusi dhidi ya SARS-CoV-2 zisiwe za kufaa haraka.	Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic changes could render vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective immediately.
658	en	sw	Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.	Pili, jinomu kubwa ya RNA kwenye CoVs ina uwezo zaidi wa kubadilika umbo katika urekebishaji wa jinomu kwa ajili ya mabadiliko na uunganishaji tena, hivyo kuongeza uwezekano wa ukuaji pamoja baina ya viumbe, jambo ambalo ni la manufaa kwa kuibuka kwa CoV mpya hali zikiwa zinafaa.	Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs is more flexible in genome remodeling for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are favorable.
659	en	sw	This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.	Haya yanaungwa mkono na fremu maalum wazi zilizo tele na utendakazi wa protini zilizosimbwa kuelekea mwisho wa 3 wa jinomu.	These are supported by specific open frames abundant with functional proteins encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
660	en	sw	Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.	"Tatu, CoV bila mpangilio na mara kwa mara hubadili kiolezo wakati wa uzalishaji wa RNA kupitia utaratibu maalum wa ""copy-choice""."	Third, CoV randomly and frequently changes the template during RNA production through a special &quot;copy-choice&quot; mechanism.
661	en	sw	In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.	Ndani ya mbebaji virusi anayetumika kama chombo cha kuchanganyia, ubadilishaji wa strandi hufanyika mara kwa mara wakati wa kunakiliwa kwa CoV RNA.	Within the viral vector used as a mixing medium, strand exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
662	en	sw	Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.	RNA zinazofanana zaidi za urefu kamili na za jinomu ndogo zinaweza kuungana tena ili kuzalisha COV mpya.	More similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to generate new COVs.
663	en	sw	Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.	Ushahidi wa kifilojenetiki wa uunganishaji tena asilia umepatikana katika HCoV-HKU1 na HCoV-OC43, na vilevile virusi vyaCoV vilivyopatikana ndani ya wanyama kama vile virusi vya SL-CoV ya popo na virusi vya CoV-HKU9 vya popo.	Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoVs found in animals such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
664	en	sw	Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission	Mwingiliano wa mbebaji virusi ukihusishwa na usambazaji	Virus-carrier interactions associated with transmission
665	en	sw	Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.	Kando na vigezo vitatu vya virusi vilivyotajwa hapa juu, mwingiliano wa virusi vipokezi vya mbebaji ni kigezo kingine muhimu chenye ushawishi kwenye usambazaji baina ya viumbe.	In addition to the three virulence parameters mentioned above, host-receptive virus interaction is another important factor influencing interorganism transmission.
666	en	sw	Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.	Hapa ndani, kuunganishwa tena kwa SARS-CoV kunazingatiwa kuwa mfano wa kawaida, ambao pia ulionyesha ushahidi wa uteuzi chanya wakati wa matukio ya usambazaji baina ya viumbe.	Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
667	en	sw	Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.	Kulingana na uchanganuzi wa kiulinganisho kati ya SARS-CoV ndani ya binadamu na ngawa, SARS-CoV inadhaniwa kuzoeleka haraka ndani ya wabebaji tofauti, hasa kwa mabadiliko katika RBD ya protini ya S.	Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV in humans and pigs, SARS-CoV is thought to adapt rapidly in different carriers, mainly due to changes in the RBD of the S protein.
668	en	sw	Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.	Kwa jumla, RBD kwenye protini ya S ya CoV huingiliana na kipokezi cha seli na huteuliwa kwa kina na jibu la antibodi ya mbebaji.	In general, the RBD on the S protein of CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is extensively recruited by the host&#39;s antibody response.
669	en	sw	In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.	Katika SARS-CoV, RBD ndiyo asidi amino ya 318 na ya 510 katika kipande cha S1, ambayo hunata ACE2 ya kibinadamu pamoja na vipokezi vikuu kwa ajili ya kuingia kwa virusi.	In SARS-CoV, the RBD is the 318th and 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds human ACE2 with major receptors for viral entry.
670	en	sw	The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.	RBD ya SARS-CoV ina uwezo wa kutambua vipokezi vya ACE2 vya wanyama mbalimbali, ikiwa ni pamoja na popo, ngawa, panya na mbwa, na kuruhusu usambazaji wa virusi baina ya viumbe.	The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, monkeys, mice and dogs, allowing the virus to spread between organisms.
671	en	sw	In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.	Hakika, ni mabaki 6 ya asidi amino pekee ndiyo yalipatikana kuwa tofauti kutoka kwa virusi vilivyotengwa kutoka kwa binadamu na ngawa kwenye RBD na 4 kati yazo ziko katika sehemu ya kuunganisha vipokezi kwa ajili ya miingiliano na kipokezi cha ACE2.	Indeed, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from viruses isolated from humans and guinea pigs in the RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor binding site for interactions with the ACE2 receptor.
672	en	sw	Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.	Virusi vya SARS-CoV vilivyo ndani ya Ngawa vina mabadiliko ya K479N na S487T kwenye RBD yavyo, jambo linaloweza kuzidisha uwezekano wa mwingiliano wa protini ya S na vipokezi vya binadamu vya ACE2.	The SARS-CoV virus in Ngawa has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the possibility of interaction of the S protein with human ACE2 receptors.
673	en	sw	In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.	Yaani, ubadilishaji wa asidi amino hizi mbili unaweza kuwa muhimu katika virusi kuzoeleka kwa binadamu.	That is, the exchange of these two amino acids may be important for the virus to adapt to humans.
674	en	sw	It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.	Ni muhimu kukumbuka kwamba virusi vya SARS-CoV-2 vina vipokezi sawa vya seli na SARS-CoV.	It is important to remember that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
675	en	sw	A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.	Tofauti ya 30% kati ya SARS-CoV-2 na SARS-CoV kwenye kitengo cha S1 cha protini ya S huashiria kwamba uwezo wa protini ya S kuunganishwa na ACE2 ya binadamu huenda umebadilisha.	The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein indicates that the ability of the S protein to bind to human ACE2 may have changed.
676	en	sw	Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.	Bila shaka, utafiti wa cryo-EM unaonyesha uwezekano wa mnato wa 10- hadi 20-zaidi wa mnato huu kuliko kati ya protini ya binadamu ya ACE2 na ya SARS-CoV S.	Indeed, cryo-EM studies indicate a potential 10- to 20-fold higher viscosity than that between the human ACE2 protein and that of SARS-CoV S.
677	en	sw	It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.	Iitakuwa jambo la kuvutia kubaini iwapo vitambuzi vyovyote vyenza vinaweza kuhitajika kwa ajili ya usambazaji wa SARS-CoV-2.	It will be interesting to determine whether any other sensors may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Along with cellular receptors, the outcome of HCoV transmission between organisms is also governed by interdependence with other carriers and inhibition parameters.
682	en	sw	The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.	Tofauti ya protini hizi za wanyama wabebaji kati ya binadamu na wabebaji asilia wahifadhi wa virusi vya HCoV kama vile popo, ngamia warefu zaidi na wanyama wagugunaji huenda ukawa kikwazo kwa usambazaji baina ya viumbe.	Differences in these animal proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoV viruses such as bats, camels and ruminants may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.

Kwa mfano, kupata au kupoteza jeni mpya inayosimba protini kuna uwezekano wa kubadilisha haraka sampuli ya virusi.	For example, the acquisition or loss of a new gene that encodes a protein has the potential to rapidly change the viral sample.
691	en	sw	Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.	Miongoni mwa protini za ufikiaji za SARS-CoV, ORF8 imedhaniwa kuwa muhimu katika kuzoeleka kwa binadamu, kwa kuwa virusi vya SARS-CoV vinavyohusiana na popo vilitolewa lakini vikapatikana kusimba protini tofauti za ORF8.	Among the SARS-CoV accession proteins, ORF8 has been hypothesized to be important in human adaptation, since the bat-related SARS-CoV virus was isolated but found to encode a different ORF8 protein.

Kando na SARS-CoV na MERS-CoV, matukio ya kuunganishwa tena kuwa aina nyingine ya HCoV yameshuhudiwa pia, ambapo HCoV mbalimbali huunganishwa tena na na virusi vingine vya CoV vya wanyama kwenye jeni zao zisizo na umbo.	In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of recombination into other types of HCoVs have also been witnessed, where various HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their nonspecific genes.
698	en	sw	It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.	Tahadhari pia inapaswa kukumbukwa kwamba uteuzi wa bandia unaweza kuchangia katika mabadiliko yasiyonuiwa katika jinomu za virusi, mara nyingi kutokana na kuondolea virusi mashinikizo ya uteuzi, kama vile mfumo wa kinga ya mwili wa mbebaji virusi.	Caution should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, often due to removing the virus from selective pressures, such as the immune system of the virus carrier.
699	en	sw	An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.	Mfano wa athari hizi ni kupotea kwa urefu kamili wa ORF4 katika sampuli awali ya HCoV-229E, kutokana na kufutwa kwa nukleotidi mbili.	An example of these effects is the loss of the full-length ORF4 in the original sample of HCoV-229E, due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
700	en	sw	While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.	Huku ORF4 thabiti ikiwa na uwezekano wa kupatikana kwenye virusi vinavyopatikana kwenye popo na ngamia vinavyohusiana na HCoV-229E, virusi vya alpha-CoV vilivyopatikana kwenye alpaca vilionyesha kuwekwa kwa nukleotidi moja, kukisababisha kubadilika kwa fremu.	While a stable ORF4 is likely found in viruses found in bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV virus found in alpacas showed a single nucleotide insertion, causing a frame shift.

For example, adaptation errors in bats have been shown to reduce CoV-mediated disease-causing capacity.
705	en	sw	Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.	Vilevile, shughuli ya seli ya uuwaji asilia kwenye popo imedidimizwa kutokana na kuzalishwa kwa vipokezi vizuizi vya seli ya uuwaji asilia ya NKG2/CD94 na kiwango cha chini cha molekuli za aina ya I za mchanganyiko wa uoanifu wa tishu.	Also, mast cell activity in bats is suppressed due to overproduction of the mast cell inhibitory receptors NKG2/CD94 and low levels of histocompatibility complex type I molecules.
706	en	sw	Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.	Isitoshe, kiwango kikubwa cha aina za oksijeni tendaji (ROS) zinazozalishwa kutokana na shughuli nyingi mwilini mwa popo zinaweza kudidimiza mwigo wa CoV na kuathiri mapitio ya Eksoribonuklisi, hivyo kutoa shinikizo la uteuzi kwa ajili ya uzalishaji wa aina ya virusi vilivyo na uwezo mkuu wa kusababisha ugonjwa vinapoingizwa katika mazingira mapya.	In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced due to high activity in the bat body can inhibit CoV replication and affect the exoribonuclease pathway, thus providing selection pressure for the production of virus strains with high causative potential. disease when introduced into a new environment.

Dalili kali mara nyingi hutokana na kuchochewa sana na kinga ya mwili kupigana kupita kiasi na mlipuko wa saitokini ambapo kinga ya mwili likiwa thabiti sana, mapafu huharibika zaidi.	Severe symptoms often result from overstimulation of the body&#39;s immune system to fight excessively with a cytokine blast where the body&#39;s immune system is too strong, the lungs become more damaged.
713	en	sw	In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.	Kwa upande mwingine, katika wabebaji wasio na dalili, makabiliano ya kinga ya mwili hutenganishwa kutoka kwa uzalishaji wa CoV.	On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is dissociated from CoV production.
